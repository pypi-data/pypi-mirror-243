Calibur, a sword towards the many inconsistent and ambiguous conventions
(viewport origins, depth range, camera coordinate systems, etc.) in computer graphics and vision.

It is a library that translates between these conventions for you.
It also hosts as a library of documentation of different conventions and space definitions in CG and CV
that would otherwise be hard to find.

## Installation

```bash
pip install calibur
```
