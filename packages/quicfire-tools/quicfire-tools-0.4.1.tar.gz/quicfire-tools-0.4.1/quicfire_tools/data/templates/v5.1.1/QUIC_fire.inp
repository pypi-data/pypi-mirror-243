! FIRE TIMES
$timenow		    ! When the fire is ignited in Unix Epoch time (integer seconds since 1970/1/1 00:00:00). Must be greater or equal to the time of the first wind

1					! Number of fire time steps done before updating the quic wind field (integer, >= 1)
$output_time		! After how many fire time steps to print out fire-related files (excluding emissions and radiation)
$output_time		! After how many quic updates to print out wind-related files
$output_time		! After how many fire time steps to average emissions and radiation
$output_time		! After how many quic updates to print out averaged wind-related files
! FIRE GRID
$nz					! Number of vertical layers of fire grid cells (integer)
