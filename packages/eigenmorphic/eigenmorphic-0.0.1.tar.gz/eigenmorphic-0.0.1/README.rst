eigenmorphic
================

Eigenvalues of morphic subshifts.

This is a Sage optional package.
It contains code to compute exact additive eigenvalues
of morphic subshifts, that is a substitution subshift or
the subshift generated by its image by another substitution.

Installation::

  sage -pip install eigenmorphic
  
Usage::

    sage: from eigenmorphic import *


After this command, you can play with free groups and their automorphisms::

    sage: s = WordMorphism("a->ab,b->ac,c->a")
    sage: morphic_eigenvalues(s)
    Z*{1, b, b^2}
	where b is root of x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
	
	sage: t = WordMorphism('a->0,b->1,c->1')
	sage: morphic_eigenvalues(s, t)
	Z*{1, b, b^2}
	where b is root of x^3 - x^2 - x - 1
