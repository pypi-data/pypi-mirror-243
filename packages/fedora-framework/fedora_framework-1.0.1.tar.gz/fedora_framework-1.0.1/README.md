The Fedora Framework is an evolutionary feature engineering framework designed to streamline the process of creating and optimizing features for machine learning tasks. This project offers a flexible and extensible set of tools for feature engineering to help data scientists and machine learning engineers efficiently prepare their data for modelling.

## Features

* **Modular Design:** Fedora Framework is built around a modular architecture that allows you to extend and customize feature engineering components easily. You can mix and match different modules to suit your specific needs, using Context-Free Grammars.
* **Automated Feature Generation:** Fedora Framework provides built-in tools for automatic feature generation, reducing the manual effort required to create features. You can define feature operators and let the framework generate features based on your specifications.
* **Feature Selection and Construction:** Identify and select the most important features for your models using various feature engineering techniques.

## Installation

You can install Fedora Framework from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fedora-framework/) using pip:

```bash
pip3 install fedora-framework
```

## Getting Started

After installing the Fedora framework, check our examples in classical machine learning datasets in the [examples](https://github.com/miguelrabuge/fedora/tree/main/examples) folder. Once inside this directory, to run the MNIST dataset example:

```bash
cd mnist
python3 main.py
```
