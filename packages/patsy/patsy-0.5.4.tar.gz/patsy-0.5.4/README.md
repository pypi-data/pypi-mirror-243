# Patsy

**Notice:** `patsy` is no longer under active development. As of August 2021,
Matthew Wardrop (@matthewwardrop) and Tom√°s Capretto (@tomicapretto) have taken
on responsibility from Nathaniel Smith (@njsmith) for keeping the lights on, but
no new feature development is planned. The spiritual successor of this project
is [Formulaic](https://github.com/matthewwardrop/formulaic), and we
recommend those interested in new feature development contribute there. Those
whose use-cases continue to be met by `patsy` can continue using this package
with increased confidence that things will continue to work as is for the
foreseeable future.

Patsy is a Python library for describing statistical models
(especially linear models, or models that have a linear component) and
building design matrices. Patsy brings the convenience of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) "formulas" to Python.
