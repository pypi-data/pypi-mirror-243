A simple and straight-forward Python module for creating context-dependent proxy objects.

As for now, the documentation is mostly in the codebase (check relevant docstrings of `proxy()`, `const_proxy()`, `lookup_proxy()`, `proxy_field_accessor()`, `proxy_item_accessor()` and `proxy_attribute_accessor()` for more information).
