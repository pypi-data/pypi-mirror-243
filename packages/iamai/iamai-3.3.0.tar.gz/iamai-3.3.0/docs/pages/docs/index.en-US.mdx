# Introduction

iamai is a cross-platform robot framework based on [alicebot](https://github.com/AliceBotProject/alicebot) and [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). It allows for quick usage of various convenient NLP models, such as named entity recognition and relation extraction.

This documentation is based on Alicebot [Docs](https://docs.alicebot.dev), but with some modifications and improvements. It still has many shortcomings and is currently under reconstruction.
