class WarmupSequenceLoss(Module):
    r"""Implements a wrapper to adapt PyTorch loss on sequences with a
    warm-up approach.

    The loss is computed only on the time steps after the warm-up to
    give the model time to warm-up its internal state before making a
    prediction. If ``warmup=5``, the loss is not computed on the first
    five time steps. This loss function assumes that all the sequences
    have the same length.

    This wrapper assumes the loss function has the following two
    inputs:

        - a tensor of prediction of shape
            ``(sequence_length, batch_size, *)`` if
            ``batch_size=False`` or
            ``(batch_size, sequence_length, *)`` otherwise.
        - a tensor of target of shape
            ``(sequence_length, batch_size, *)`` if
            ``batch_size=False`` or
            ``(batch_size, sequence_length, *)`` otherwise.

    Internally, this loss function converts the batch of sequences
    as a batch of examples i.e. the sequence and batch dimensions are
    merged together. Most of the PyTorch criteria work on a batch
    examples i.e. tensors of dimension ``(batch_size, *)`` where ``*``
    means, any number of additional dimensions.

    Note: this is an experimental loss function.

    Args:
    ----
        criterion (``torch.nn.Module`` or dict): Specifies the loss
            function/criterion or its configuration.
        warmup (int, optional): Specifies the number of warmup steps.
            Note that this value should be compatible with
            input dimension. Default: ``0``
        batch_first (bool, optional): Indicates if the first dimension
            is the batch or the sequence. If ``True``, the input
            sequence should have the shape
            ``(batch_size, sequence_length, *)``, otherwise
            ``(sequence_length, batch_size, *)``. Default: ``False``
