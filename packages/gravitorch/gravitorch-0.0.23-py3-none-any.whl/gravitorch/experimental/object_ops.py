def add_objects(object1: Any, object2: Any) -> Any:
    r"""Performs an element-wise addition of two objects.

    Equivalent to: ``object1 + object2``.

    The current implementation supports the following object types:

        - int
        - float
        - ``torch.Tensor``
        - ``numpy.ndarray``
        - ``list``
        - ``tuple``
        - ``dict``

    The set are not supported because it is not always possible to do
    an element-wise addition. This function assumes that both objects
    have the same structure, and it is possible to do an element-wise
    operation between the values. For example if
    ``object1['my_list']`` is a list, it is expected that
    ``object2['my_list']`` is also a list.

    Args:
    ----
        object1: Specifies the first object
        object2: Specifies the second object

    Returns:
    -------
        The element-wise addition of the two objects.
