## Composer Prototype
### Composer Interactive UI
make sure you have in your root dir:

```
feeds.yaml # to store generated feeds
profile.yaml # to store an example user profile
```

### Data Generation

make sure you have in your root dir:
```
composer-finetune.jsonl
composer-dataset.jsonl
composer-dataset-methods.jsonl
```
Generate synthetic dataset:
`python -m examples.composer.scripts.synt_dataset_generate`
`python -m examples.composer.scripts.method_dataset_generate`

### Finetuning
`python -m examples.composer.scripts.finetune`

TODO:
- support finetuning existing model instead of creating new fintune tasks on new model
- improve dataset gen and finetuning tasks

### Upload Package on Pypi
from root of composer:
`python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`
`twine upload dist/*`
