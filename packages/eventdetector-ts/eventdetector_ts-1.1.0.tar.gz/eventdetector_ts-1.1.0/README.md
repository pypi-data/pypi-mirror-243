## Introduction
We present a new `Universal` deep-learning supervised method for detecting events in
multivariate time series data. This method combines `4` distinct
novelties compared to existing deep-learning supervised methods.
Firstly, it is based on `regression` instead of binary classification.
Secondly, it `does not require labeled datasets` where each point is
labeled; instead, it only requires reference events defined as time
points or intervals of time. Thirdly, it is designed to be `robust`
through the use of a stacked ensemble learning metamodel that
combines deep learning models, from classic Feed-Forward
Neural Networks (FFNs) to the state-of-the-art architectures like
Transformers. By leveraging the collective strengths of multiple
models, this ensemble approach can mitigate individual model
weaknesses and biases, resulting in more robust predictions.
Finally, to facilitate practical implementation, we have developed
this package called `EventDetector` to accompany the proposed method. 
It provides a rich support for event detection in time series. We establish `mathematically` that our method is universal, and capable of detecting any type of event with arbitrary precision under mild continuity assumptions on the time series. These events may encompass change points, frauds, anomalies, physical occurrences, and more. We substantiate our theoretical results using the universal approximation theorem. Additionally, we provide empirical validations that confirm our claims, demonstrating that our method, with a limited number of parameters, outperforms other deep learning approaches, particularly for rare events and imbalanced datasets from different domains.

#### Training and Validation Losses

The Figure below showcases the training loss and validation loss of the FFNs on the Bow Shock Crossings and Credit Card Frauds.
The low losses observed in both cases indicate that the metamodel has successfully learned the underlying patterns,
justifying the obtained good metrics.

| `time_window`               | Union[int, float]                        | This parameter controls the amount of data within the dataset is used for the training process. If it's an integer, it represents a specific number time steps.  If it's a float, it represents a duration in seconds. By default, it is set to None, which means all available data will be used. However, if a value is provided, the dataset will include a specific interval of data surrounding each reference event. This interval includes data from both sides of each event, with a duration equal to the specified `time_window`. Setting a `time_window` in some situations can offer several advantages, such as accelerating the training process and enhancing the neural networks' understanding of rare events. | None                                   |

#### The method `fit`
The method `fit` calls automatically the following methods: 
##### Prepare data for computing the overlapping parameter `op`
The second thing to do is to prepare the events and the dataset for computing `op`:
```python
meta_model.prepare_data_and_computing_op()
```

##### Stacking Ensemble Learning Pipeline
The third thing to do is to build a stacking learning pipeline using the provided models and hyperparameters:

```python
meta_model.build_stacking_learning()
```

##### Event Extraction Optimization
The fourth thing to do is to run the Event Extraction Optimization process:

```python
meta_model.event_extraction_optimization()
```

##### Get The Results and Plots
Finally, you can plot the results, which are saved automatically: losses, true/predicted ops, true/predicted events, and delta_t.

```python
meta_model.plot_save(show_plots=True)
```

# Future Works
In our future works, we aim to enhance our modelâs capabilities by predicting events of varying durations. This would be a significant improvement over our current approach, which only predicts the midpoint of events with a fixed duration.
