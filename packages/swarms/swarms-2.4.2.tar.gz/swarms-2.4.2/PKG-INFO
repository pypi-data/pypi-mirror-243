## Installation
`pip3 install --upgrade swarms`

---

## Usage

Run example in Collab: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/kyegomez/swarms/blob/master/playground/swarms_example.ipynb">
<img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>

### `Flow` Example
- Reliable Structure that provides LLMS autonomy
- Extremely Customizeable with stopping conditions, interactivity, dynamical temperature, loop intervals, and so much more
- Enterprise Grade + Production Grade: `Flow` is designed and optimized for automating real-world tasks at scale!

```python

from swarms.models import OpenAIChat
from swarms.structs import Flow

api_key = ""

# Initialize the language model, this model can be swapped out with Anthropic, ETC, Huggingface Models like Mistral, ETC
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
)

## Initialize the workflow
flow = Flow(
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=2,
    dashboard=True,

)

out = flow.run("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.")


```

------

### `SequentialWorkflow`
- A Sequential swarm of autonomous agents where each agent's outputs are fed into the next agent
- Save and Restore Workflow states!
- Integrate Flow's with various LLMs and Multi-Modality Models

```python
from swarms.models import OpenAIChat, BioGPT, Anthropic
from swarms.structs import Flow
from swarms.structs.sequential_workflow import SequentialWorkflow


# Example usage
api_key = (
    ""  # Your actual API key here
)

# Initialize the language flow
llm = OpenAIChat(
    openai_api_key=api_key,
    temperature=0.5,
    max_tokens=3000,
)

biochat = BioGPT()

# Use Anthropic
anthropic = Anthropic()

# Initialize the agent with the language flow
agent1 = Flow(llm=llm, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)

# Create another agent for a different task
agent2 = Flow(llm=llm, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)

# Create another agent for a different task
agent3 = Flow(llm=biochat, max_loops=1, dashboard=False)

# agent4 = Flow(llm=anthropic, max_loops="auto")

# Create the workflow
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(max_loops=1)

# Add tasks to the workflow
workflow.add("Generate a 10,000 word blog on health and wellness.", agent1)

# Suppose the next task takes the output of the first task as input
workflow.add("Summarize the generated blog", agent2)

workflow.add("Create a references sheet of materials for the curriculm", agent3)

# Run the workflow
workflow.run()

# Output the results
for task in workflow.tasks:
    print(f"Task: {task.description}, Result: {task.result}")

```

## `Multi Modal Autonomous Agents`
- Run the flow with multiple modalities useful for various real-world tasks in manufacturing, logistics, and health.

```python
from swarms.structs import Flow
from swarms.models.gpt4_vision_api import GPT4VisionAPI

# Initialize the llm
llm = GPT4VisionAPI()

task = "Analyze this image of an assembly line and identify any issues such as misaligned parts, defects, or deviations from the standard assembly process. IF there is anything unsafe in the image, explain why it is unsafe and how it could be improved."
img = "assembly_line.jpg"

## Initialize the workflow
flow = Flow(
    llm=llm,
    max_loops=1,
    dashboard=True,
)

# Run the flow
flow.run(task=task, img=img)


```
