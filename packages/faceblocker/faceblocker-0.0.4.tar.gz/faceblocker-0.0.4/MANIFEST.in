# The patterns here are glob-style patterns: * matches zero or more regular filename characters (on Unix, everything except forward slash; on Windows, everything except backslash and colon); ? matches a single regular filename character, and [chars] matches any one of the characters between the square brackets (which may contain character ranges, e.g., [a-z] or [a-fA-F0-9]). Setuptools also has undocumented support for ** matching zero or more characters including forward slash, backslash, and colon.
# Directory patterns are relative to the root of the project directory; e.g., graft example* will include a directory named examples in the project root but will not include docs/examples/.
