Tutorials for APT data processing
============================================================

The data processing tutorial, number 0, is a simple user friendly guide to crop, calibrate, 3d reconstruct, range, and visualize the data.
This tutorial is a good starting point for new users which use widgets to make it easy to process the data.

If you need more control over the data processing, you can use the other tutorials, number 1 to 5, which are more advanced.

For propagation delay calculation you can use tutorial 6.
