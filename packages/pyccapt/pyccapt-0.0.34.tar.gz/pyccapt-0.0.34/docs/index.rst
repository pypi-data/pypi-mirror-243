PyCCAPT:  A modular, FAIR open-source Python package for controlling and calibrating atom probe tomography
===================================

Historically, atom probe tomography (APT) detection systems have used compiled systems with hardware-software co-design to deal with the high data rates generated at the detector.
In recent years, while computer hardware power has continuously increased, the rate of atoms measured has not significantly increased due to the physical limitations of the experiment [1].
As a result, more and more computationally expensive high level programming approaches can be used to control APT instruments.
Additionally, the highly complex field evaporation in laser pulsed atom probe has made it highly desirable to get ever deeper insights into the detector events [2].

PyCCAPT is an open-source atom probe control and calibrate system written in the Python programming language.
The collected data is stored in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data format (HDF5) which contains all data collected during the experiment, including detector raw data.
This control system therefore provides the basis of a fully FAIR atom probe data collection and analysis chain.

Documentation
========================
The documentation webpage of PyCCAPT modules can be found `here <https://pyccapt.readthedocs.io/>`_.


Most PyCCAPT software outputs are in the form of
`Pandas DataFrames <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html>`_, offering flexibility for seamless expansion with
additional information across various levels of analysis. The control and calibration data structures can be referenced
`here <https://pyccapt.readthedocs.io/>`_. and `here <https://pyccapt.readthedocs.io/>`_., respectively. Leveraging the capabilities of Pandas allows users to work with the analyzed data effortlessly,
facilitating interoperability with software tools such as MATLAB and Microsoft Excel.

The choice of HDF5 as a storage format is notable for its widespread readability across different programming languages.
HDF5 adopts a file directory-like structure, enabling users to organize data systematically within the file. Moreover,
HDF5 supports large, intricate, and heterogeneous datasets. Its inherent structure facilitates self-description,
as users can embed metadata, enhancing the overall comprehensibility of the stored information.
