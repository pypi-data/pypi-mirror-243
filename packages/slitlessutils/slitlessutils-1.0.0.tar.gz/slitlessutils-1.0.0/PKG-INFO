Slitlessutils is a package for simulating and extracting wide-field slitless spectroscopy (WFSS) data, highly focused on data from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and Wide-Field Camera 3 (WFC3) on the *Hubble Space Telescope*.


## Early Development Software Warning
Slitlessutils is under active development software and subject to change.


## Quickstart

The latest released version of this package can be installed using pip
from the command line:
```
pip install slitlessutils
```

To install the latest development version of this repository, please use:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/spacetelescope/slitlessutils.git
```

You also need to obtain the calibration (reference) files, which are stored in a public box folder, which can be done with the slitlessutils config objects.  Please see [configuring slitlessutils](https://slitlessutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configure.html)
for instructions and examples.  Please see our [documentation](https://slitlessutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
for additional installation instructions and/or methods.

We have encountered several frequently-asked questions and give some examples our [FAQ page](https://slitlessutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html).
