+'The following fuctions are avaliable: *export()*, *add()*, *export_from()*, *export_from_to()* to export measured data to . '\
+'In addition, the function *export_help()* can be used to general help for export functions. '\

+'-'*len('Properties of export functions:  ')+'\n \n'\
+'export: Exports files, will be merged if - is used, and exported one by one if space is used. Examples: export 296-297 298 will merge 296 and 297, while 298 is exported by itself. \n \n'\
+'exportAll: All scans will be exported individually. Example: exportAll 280-290 will export all files in the range individually. \n \n'\
+'add: All scans will be added. Example: add 296-297 300 will merge all the scans. \n \n'\
+'sortExport: Will go sort all scans by sampleName and title, and group them. Scans with same sampleName and title will be merged. Example: sortExport 280-290. sortExport can also ignore files by ignore=XXX. Example: sortExport 290-300 ignore=295 will export 290-294,296-300. \n \n'\
+'sleepExport: Runs sortExport with a time interval given in seconds. If no start value is given, it will run over all files in the folder. An end value can also be given but is not mandatory or recommended. Example: sleepExport 600, sleepExport 600 start=270 end=300. sleepExport can also ignore files by ignore=XXX. Example: sleepExport 20 start=290 end=300 ignore=295 will export 290-294,296-300. \n \n'\

+'dTheta=0.125 - stepsize for binning of output data. Example:  export 296-297 dTheta=0.175 \n \n'\
+'useMask=True - export files with and without an angular mask. Example: export 296-297 useMask=False does not export _HR files where an angular mask is used. \n \n'\
+'maxAngle=5 - the angle of the angular mask. Example: export 296-297 maxAngle=3 \n \n'\
+'onlyHR=False - export files only with a mask. export 296-297 onlyHR =True only export HR files made with an angular mask. \n \n'\
+'applyNormalization=True - use vanadium calibration to correct for pixel efficacy. Example: export 296-297 applyNormalization=False does not use the calibration for the export of the scan. \n \n'\
+'correctedTwoTheta=True - integrate in Q or vertically on the detector. Example:  export 296-297 correctedTwoTheta=False gives vertical integration of the scan. \n \n'\
+'twoThetaOffset=0 - shit of two theta if a4 in the file is incorrect. Not recommended to use. Example: export 296-297 twoThetaOffset=3 \n \n \n'\

+'fileNumber=False - Include file numbers in the name of output file. Can be useful if exporting scans with same sampleName and title, and you dont want to overwrite the file. Example: export 296-297 fileNumber=True \n \n'\
+'waveLength=False - Include wavelength in the name of output file. Can be useful for experiments with different wavelengths. Example: export 296-297 waveLength=True \n \n'\
+'magField=False: Include magnetic field in the name of output file. \n \n'\
+'elField=False: Include electric field in the name of output file. \n \n'\
