+'UB matrices is stored in the sample object in DMCpy and can be saved and loaded as binary files. '\
+'DMC only measure one scattering plane and conventional indexing will not work as information in one direction will be missing. '\
+'DMCpy therefore has a few alternative methods for generating UB matrices. \n'\
+'alignToRefs is the recommended method for alignment. It is a method that takes two QxQyQz coordinates, which is used to tilt and rotate the data. \n\n'\
+'alignToRef is a method which takes one spesific QxQyQz coordinates, which is used to tilt and rotate the data. \n\n'\
+'autoAlignScatteringPlane has the following method which is useful when many peaks are measured. \n'\
+'1) Perform a 3D binning of data in to equi-sized bins with size (dx,dy,dz) \n'\
+'2) Peaks are defined as all positions having intensities>threshold \n'\
+'3) These peaks are clustered together if closer than 0.02 1/AA and centre of gravity using intensity is applied to find common centre. \n'\
+'4) Above step is repeated with custom distanceThreshold \n'\
+'5) Plane normals are found as cross products between all vectors connecting all found peaks -> Gives a list of approximately NPeaks*(NPeaks-1)*(NPeaks-2) \n'\
+'6) Plane normals are clustered and most common is used \n'\
+'7) Peaks are rotated into the scattering plane \n'\
+'8) Within the plane all found peaks are projected along the nice plane vectors and the peak having the scattering length closest to an integer multiple of either is chosen for alignment \n'\
+'9) Rotation within the plane is found by rotating the found peak either along x or y  depending on which projection vector was closest \n'\
+'10) Sample is updated with found rotations. \n\n'\
