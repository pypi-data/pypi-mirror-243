introText = 'In a single crystal experiment, the first step is to gain an overview of the system. This is most often done '\
+'by performing an A3 scan with the sample in a specific scattering plane. Due to the 2D detector of DMC, such an A3 scan produces '\
+'a 3D set of measured data points. In the frame of reference of the instrument, the majority of the covered volume is '\
+'in the Qx-Qy plane, i.e. with Qz close to zero. A single A3 slices corresponds to a curved line in th Qx-Qy '\
+' together with a symmetrically curved line in Qz. This sheet is then rotated around the origin with each A3 step.'\
+'The Interactive Viewer sums intensities in one direction to give 2D figures of measured intensities. '\
+'In total 3 figures are then generated: summer over z, summed over A3 and summed over 2theta. '\
+'The graphics are interactive and by clicking in the summed over z you change the A3. '\
+'\n\n'\
+'A useful feature is to use a defined A3 range to subtract background from a sample can. '\
+'The given area is averaged and subtracted from the entire data set. '\
+'This does not work well with A3-dependent powder rings and background subtracted data should not be used for cuts and integration. '\
