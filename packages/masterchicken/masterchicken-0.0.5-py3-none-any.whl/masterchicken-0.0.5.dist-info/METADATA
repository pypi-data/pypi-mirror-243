coop = Coop.Coop()
chicken = coop.create(type='egg')
chicken.hatch()
if chicken.get_hatched():
    print("Congratulations!! You have hatched a chicken")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print(f"Chicken Stats: {chicken.get_status}")
```

### Basic CSV

```python
from masterchicken.csv import read_csv
import numpy as np

file_path = 'map/chicken.csv'
group_by_column = 'token_id'
columns_to_print = np.array(['chicken_name', 'type', 'hatch_date', 'token_id', 'achievements', 'collections',
                             'flying_eligibility', 'drumstick_value'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    
    data_frame = read_csv(file_path, delimiter=',', quotechar='"', encoding='utf-8', skiprows=0,
                          group_by=group_by_column, columns_to_print=None, group_entire_print=False)
    if data_frame is not None:
        # Convert 'type' column to a list and print
        type_column_as_list = data_frame['type'].tolist()
        print(type_column_as_list)
        print("1. type: " + type_column_as_list[1])
        print("2. type: " + type_column_as_list[2])
