# Intro

A fork of onlyfans-scraper. It has been optimized to make it more feature complete with DIGITALCRIMINALS' onlyfans script.
A matter of fact with the right settings transitioning between the two scripts should be a easy enough process

In addition there are numerous filtering features to control exactly which type of content you want to scrape.

# Migrating from DC script

You will need to change the settings so that the metadata option is compatible with your current folders
Additionally you might want to set the save_path, dir_path, and filename so they output similar outputs

The metadata path from DIGITALCRIMINALS' script is used for duplicate check so as long as your set the right path.
Files won't download a second time
