# quasar_unred

Quasar Unred is a Python library for determining the E(B-V) value of observed quasar spectra. It can also be used to appropriately deredden these spectra.

## Installation

pip install quasar_unred

qso_template.txt must be downloaded and in working directory for load_template() to work with no argument.
## Usage

A simple demonstration is shown in quasar_unred_demo.ipynb

It is assumed that qso_template.txt and ukfs1037.p0236.final.dat are both downloaded and in your working directory.

## Dependencies

Dependencies for use are numpy, scipy, astropy, and dust_extinction
