# SHAP-IQ: SHAP Interaction Quantification
> An interaction may speak more than a thousand main effects.

SHAP Interaction Quantification (short SHAP-IQ) is an **XAI framework** extending on the well-known `shap` explanations by introducing interactions to the equation.
Shapley interactions extend on indivdual Shapley values by quantifying the **synergy** effect between machine learning entities such as features, data points, or weak learners in ensemble models.
Synergies between these entities (also called players in game theory jargon) allows for a more intricate evaluation of your **black-box** models!

# üõ†Ô∏è Install
**shapiq** is intended to work with **Python 3.9 and above**. Installation can be done via `pip`:

```sh
pip install shapiq
```

# ‚≠ê Quickstart

## üìà Compute n-SII values

## üìä Visualize your Interactions

One handy way of visualizing interaction scores (up to order 2) are network plots.
You can see an example of such a plot below.
The nodes represent **attribution** scores and the edges represent the **interactions**.
The strength and size of the nodes and edges are proportional to the absolute value of the
attribution scores and interaction scores, respectively.

```python
from shapiq.plot import network_plot

network_plot(
    first_order_values=n_sii_first_order,  # first order n-SII values
    second_order_values=n_sii_second_order # second order n-SII values
)
```

The pseudo-code above can produce the following plot (here also an image is added):
