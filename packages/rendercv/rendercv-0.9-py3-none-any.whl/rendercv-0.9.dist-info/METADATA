RenderCV is a Python application that creates a $\LaTeX$ CV as a PDF from a JSON/YAML input file. Currently, it only supports one theme (*classic*). An example PDF can be seen [here](https://github.com/sinaatalay/rendercv/blob/main/John_Doe_CV.pdf?raw=true). More themes are planned to be supported in the future.

**What does it do?**

- It parses a YAML (or JSON) file that looks like this:
```yaml
cv:
  name: John Doe
  label: Mechanical Engineer
  location: Geneva, Switzerland
  email: johndoe@example.com
  phone: "+33749882538"
  website: https://example.com

      start_date: "2022-06-15"
      end_date: "2022-08-01"
      highlights:
        - AmIACompany is a **technology** (markdown is
          supported) company that provides web-based
          engineering applications that enable the
          simulation and optimization of products and
          manufacturing tools.
        - Modeled and simulated a metal-forming process deep
          drawing using finite element analysis with
          open-source software called CalculiX.
```
- Then, it validates the input, such as checking if the dates are consistent, checking if the URLs are correct, etc.
- Then, it creates a $\LaTeX$ file.
- Finally, it renders the $\LaTeX$ file to generate the PDF, and you don't need $\LaTeX$ installed on your PC because RenderCV comes with [TinyTeX](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).

## Quick Start Guide

1.  Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.10 or newer).
2.  Run the command below to install RenderCV.
    ```bash
    pip install rendercv
    ```
3.  Run the command below to generate a sample input file (`Full_Name_CV.yaml`). The file will be generated in the current working directory.
    ```bash
    rendercv new "Full Name"
    ```
4.  Edit the contents of the `Full_Name_CV.yaml` file.
5.  Run the command below to generate your $\LaTeX$ CV.
    ```bash
    rendercv render Full_Name_CV.yaml
    ```

## Detailed User Guide and Documentation

A more detailed user guide can be found [here](https://sinaatalay.github.io/rendercv/user_guide).

I documented the whole code with docstrings and used comments throughout the code. The API reference can be found [here](https://sinaatalay.github.io/rendercv/api_reference/).

## Contributing

All contributions to RenderCV are welcome, especially adding new $\LaTeX$ themes.
