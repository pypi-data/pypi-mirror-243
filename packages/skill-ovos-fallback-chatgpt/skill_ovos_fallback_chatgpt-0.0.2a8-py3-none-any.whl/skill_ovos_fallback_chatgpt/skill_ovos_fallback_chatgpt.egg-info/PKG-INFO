Description: # ChatGPT Fallback Skill
        
        When in doubt, ask chatgpt, powered by [OpenAI Solver](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-solver-plugin-openai-persona)
        
        You need to configure an api_key, get it at https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
        
        
        ## About 
        
        Capabilities:
        - Remembers what user said earlier in the conversation
        - Trained to decline inappropriate requests
        
        Limitations:
        
        - May occasionally generate incorrect information
        - May occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content
        - Limited knowledge of world and events after 2021
        
        ## Configuration
        
        Under skill settings you can tweak some parameters for chatGPT
        
        
        - `key` - your api_key to access OpenAI
        - `persona` - can be used to create a "persona", give a personality to chatGPT
        - `model` - LLM model to use, eg `"gpt-3.5-turbo", see all options [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)
        
        The default persona is `helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.`
        
        
        ## Examples 
        
        * "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
