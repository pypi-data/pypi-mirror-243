Pyhedron - a polyhedron implemented in Python
#################################################

There are a lot if implementations of Polyhedrons available.
Most of them are implemented in C++ because of efficiency reason.
Sometimes they offer a Python API and maybe a pip installation package.

**But:** Because these Packages are implemented in C++,
they are often difficult to install and offer a API that is not very Pythish or even ugly.

This implementation wants to solve these problems:
 * Pyhedron is implemented in pure Python
 * There is a standard pip installation Package that is easy to install.
 * It only depends on Numpy
 * It is easy to use, understand and maintain
