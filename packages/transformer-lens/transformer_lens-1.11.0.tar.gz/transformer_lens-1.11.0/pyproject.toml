# PyTorch 2.0 Bug Fix PyTorch didn't put their dependencies metadata into all wheels for 2.1.0, so
# it doesn't work with Poetry. This is a known bug - the workaround is to place them manually here
# (from the one wheel that did correctly list them). This was broken in 2.0.1 and the fix wasn't
# made for 2.1.0, however Meta are aware of the issue and once it is fixed (and the torch version
# requirement bumped) this should be removed. Note also the python version is used to specify that
# this is only added where v2 torch is installed (as per the torch version requirement above).
