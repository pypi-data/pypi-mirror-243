# txt-to-HTML-converter
A conversion tool made for converting .txt and .md files to standard HTML.

The main purpose of this program is to create TIL (Today I learned) HTML files for blogging and personal purposes. A TIL can be pretty useful to anyone creating one as they can write down important things that they learned about and share it with others, or just keep it for themselves as something to reference. However, you can also use it as a simple .txt or .md  to HTML converter. 

# How to Use
This program is meant to be run on a CLI. First, make sure that you have the latest version of python installed. You can get the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once python is installed you can call on the program in your terminal or command line by doing so `python txt_to_html.py filename.txt` or `python txt_to_html.py foldername`. **Note**: Running this program will delete the output folder so it can be recreated with updated files. So please make sure you are backing up any html files you may not want deleted in the specified output folder.
