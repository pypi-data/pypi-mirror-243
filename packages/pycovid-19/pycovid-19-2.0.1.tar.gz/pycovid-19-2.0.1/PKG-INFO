# Pycovid-19 [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fframagit.org%2Fbenjaminpillot%2Fcovid-19/master)

COVID-19 Python plots and maps

This small package allows for downloading and plotting
covid-19 confirmed cases, recovered and deaths from data
gathered by the [John Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).
It allows for country evolutions to be compared between
them, as well as for prevalence to be calculated.

## Basic usage

### Jupyter notebook
Launch Binder to get access to the online interactive Jupyter [notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fframagit.org%2Fbenjaminpillot%2Fcovid-19/master).
Once you are in the online Jupyter Lab, you just has to open the `covid-notebook`
notebook, and adapt the different functions to your own needs (countries,
case type, type of visualization, etc.).

### Local installation
To install the package locally, the following line should do the trick:

`$ pip install pycovid-19`
