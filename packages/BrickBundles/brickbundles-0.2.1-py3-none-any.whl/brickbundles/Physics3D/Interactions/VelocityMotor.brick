VelocityMotor is Interaction1DOF:
    # A velocity-driven motor provides precise and accurate control of speed and position.
    # The gain of a velocity-driven motor can be defined as the ratio of the change in motor speed to
    # the change in control input signal. It determines how responsive the motor output is to changes
    # in the input signal, thus influencing the motor's performance. Generally, higher gain motors are
    # faster and more responsive to changes in control signals, while lower gain motors are more stable but slower to act.
    gain is Real: 1000.0
    desired_speed is Real: 1.0
