        "Text": "I did an art activity at school, and it was the Yearly Music Competition for my high school buddies to participate in. If my memory serves me right, our competition happened at the end of each Western year to celebrate our achievements in an academic semester. It was extremely funny and inviting, I would say. In detail, every class had to practice at least one music performance, such as singing, dancing, or playing any musical instrument, in order to perform on the stage in front of hundreds of students and teachers at school. In my last year at high school, we made up our mind to offer a group dancing type, which, I would say, was the best time we ever had. If I\u2019m not mistaken, five of my classmates stepped out of their comfort zones to dance with me. We devoted dozens of hours to improving our performance with support from a professional choreographer whom we hired. From the bottom of my heart, it was extraordinarily remarkable as every single one of us fought so brave until the end. After weeks of preparing and enhancing on a daily basis, we finished in the first place and won our first prize from school. Everyone was astonished and over the moon for months later. Nevertheless, the journey that we went through offered so many more values and benefits for the whole team. It was a lifetime memory that I'll probably never find anywhere else.",

I will be there to listen to all kinds of stories from people. However, opening a cocktail bar is not easy. There are numerous things I have to prepare. To begin, finding a proper location is no easy task. There is countless paperwork waiting to be completed. What comes next is the staff; I need skilled and charismatic bartenders, which are quite rare. To top it all up, there is the menu, which is nearly endless.As mentioned above, finding a place for my bar is not easy. In order to have a stable flow of customers, I will put it around the downtown area. Furthermore, I will find a place where there is a mix between locals and foreigners to gain more diversity in culture as well as atmosphere. This business has always been my biggest dream since I was a child. Alcohol is harmful if consumed irresponsibly; nevertheless, mixology is an art that not many people acknowledge. Additionally, owning a bar can get me closer to the stories of everyone. Through them, I look at the world around me through different eyes.",
