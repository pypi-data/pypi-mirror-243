`scheptk` is a collection of classes and functions to model and solve machine scheduling problems using Python. It is intended basically for teaching purposes, even if the algorithms can be integrated with MOIST, a more advanced scheduling tool.

# How to use it

In order to use `scheptk` you can install it as a Python package using `pip`:

`pip install scheptk`

At this point, the clasess and functions of `scheptk` should be available. You might want to have a look at the [wiki pages](https://github.com/framinan/scheptk/wiki) to get a handle on the documentation.
