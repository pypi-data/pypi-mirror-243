Placeholdr is a robust and versatile Python library designed to facilitate seamless integration of placeholders 
within templates and their subsequent substitution with dynamic values. With its intuitive syntax and extensive 
feature set, Placeholdr empowers developers to craft dynamic and tailor-made templates for a wide range of web 
applications.

## Key Features

Placeholdr comes packed with a variety of features to enhance your template creation and management:

- **Variable Substitution**: Support for various syntaxes like `{{ variable }}`, `[[ variable ]]`, `< variable >`, etc.
- **Template Inheritance**: Efficiently manage templates with `{% block block_name %}` and `{% endblock %}` tags.
- **Includes**: Easily include external templates using `{% include "path/to/template" %}`.
- **Control Structures**: Intuitive control structures including `{% if condition %}`, `{% endif %}`, `{% for item in iterable %}`, and `{% endfor %}`.
- **Filters**: Apply filters within templates for variable manipulation (e.g., `{{ variable | filter_name }}`).
