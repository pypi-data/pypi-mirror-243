    The receiver (the [`ready()`][frequenz.channels.util.Event.ready] method) will wait
    until [`set()`][frequenz.channels.util.Event.set] is called.  At that point the
    receiver will wait again after the event is
    [`consume()`][frequenz.channels.Receiver.consume]d.

    The receiver can be completely stopped by calling
    [`stop()`][frequenz.channels.util.Event.stop].

        ```python
        import asyncio
        from frequenz.channels import Receiver
        from frequenz.channels.util import Event, select, selected_from
