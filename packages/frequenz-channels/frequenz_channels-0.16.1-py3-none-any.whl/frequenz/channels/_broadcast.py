    """A channel to broadcast messages to multiple receivers.

    `Broadcast` channels can have multiple senders and multiple receivers. Each
    message sent through any of the senders is received by all of the
    receivers.

    Internally, a broadcast receiver's buffer is implemented with just
    append/pop operations on either side of a [deque][collections.deque], which
    are thread-safe.  Because of this, `Broadcast` channels are thread-safe.

    When there are multiple channel receivers, they can be awaited
    simultaneously using [select][frequenz.channels.util.select],
    [Merge][frequenz.channels.util.Merge] or
    [MergeNamed][frequenz.channels.util.MergeNamed].

    Example:
        ``` python
        async def send(sender: channel.Sender) -> None:
            while True:
                next = random.randint(3, 17)
                print(f"sending: {next}")
                await sender.send(next)


        async def recv(id: int, receiver: channel.Receiver) -> None:
            while True:
                next = await receiver.receive()
                print(f"receiver_{id} received {next}")
                await asyncio.sleep(0.1) # sleep (or work) with the data


        bcast = channel.Broadcast()

        sender = bcast.new_sender()
        receiver_1 = bcast.new_receiver()

        asyncio.create_task(send(sender))

        await recv(1, receiver_1)
        ```
