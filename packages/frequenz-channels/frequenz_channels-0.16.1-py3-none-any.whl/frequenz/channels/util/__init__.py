"""Channel utilities.

A module with several utilities to work with channels:

* [Event][frequenz.channels.util.Event]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that can be made ready through an event.

* [FileWatcher][frequenz.channels.util.FileWatcher]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that watches for file events.

* [Merge][frequenz.channels.util.Merge]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that merge messages coming from
  multiple receivers into a single stream.

* [MergeNamed][frequenz.channels.util.MergeNamed]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that merge messages coming from
  multiple receivers into a single named stream, allowing to identify the
  origin of each message.

* [Timer][frequenz.channels.util.Timer]:
  A [receiver][frequenz.channels.Receiver] that ticks at certain intervals.

* [select][frequenz.channels.util.select]:  Iterate over the values of all
  [receivers][frequenz.channels.Receiver] as new values become available.
