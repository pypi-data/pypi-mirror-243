class TokenizerConfig:
    r"""
    MIDI tokenizer base class, containing common methods and attributes for all tokenizers.

    :param pitch_range: range of MIDI pitches to use. Pitches can take
            values between 0 and 127 (included).
            The `General MIDI 2 (GM2) specifications <https://www.midi.org/specifications-old/item/general-midi-2>`_
            indicate the **recommended** ranges of pitches per MIDI program (instrument).
            These recommended ranges can also be found in ``miditok.constants``.
            In all cases, the range from 21 to 108 (included) covers all the recommended values. When processing a
            MIDI, the notes with pitches under or above this range can be discarded. (default: ``(21, 109)``)
    :param beat_res: beat resolutions, as a dictionary in the form:
            ``{(beat_x1, beat_x2): beat_res_1, (beat_x2, beat_x3): beat_res_2, ...}``. The keys are tuples indicating
            a range of beats, ex 0 to 3 for the first bar, and the values are the resolution (in samples per beat) to
            apply to the ranges, ex 8. This allows to use ``Duration`` / ``TimeShift`` tokens of different
            lengths / resolutions. Note: for tokenization with ``Position`` tokens, the total number of possible
            positions will be set at four times the maximum resolution given (``max(beat_res.values)``\).
            (default: ``{(0, 4): 8, (4, 12): 4}``)
    :param num_velocities: number of velocity bins. In the MIDI norm, velocities can take
            up to 128 values (0 to 127). This parameter allows to reduce the number of velocity values.
            The velocities of the MIDIs resolution will be downsampled to ``num_velocities`` values, equally
            separated between 0 and 127. (default: ``32``)
    :param special_tokens: list of special tokens. This must be given as a list of strings given
            only the names of the tokens. (default: ``["PAD", "BOS", "EOS", "MASK"]``\)
    :param use_chords: will use ``Chord`` tokens, if the tokenizer is compatible.
            A ``Chord`` token indicates the presence of a chord at a certain time step.
            MidiTok uses a chord detection method based on onset times and duration. This allows MidiTok to detect
            precisely chords without ambiguity, whereas most chord detection methods in symbolic music based on
            chroma features can't. Note that using chords will increase the tokenization time, especially if you
            are working on music with a high "note density". (default: ``False``)
    :param use_rests: will use ``Rest`` tokens, if the tokenizer is compatible.
            ``Rest`` tokens will be placed whenever a portion of time is silent, i.e. no note is being played.
            This token type is decoded as a ``TimeShift`` event. You can choose the minimum and maximum rests
            values to represent with the ``beat_res_rest`` argument. (default: ``False``)
    :param use_tempos: will use ``Tempo`` tokens, if the tokenizer is compatible.
            ``Tempo`` tokens will specify the current tempo. This allows to train a model to predict tempo changes.
            Tempo values are quantized accordingly to the ``num_tempos`` and ``tempo_range`` entries in the
            ``additional_tokens`` dictionary (default is 32 tempos from 40 to 250). (default: ``False``)
    :param use_time_signatures: will use ``TimeSignature`` tokens, if the tokenizer is compatible.
            ``TimeSignature`` tokens will specify the current time signature. Note that :ref:`REMI` adds a
            ``TimeSignature`` token at the beginning of each Bar (i.e. after ``Bar`` tokens), while :ref:`TSD` and
            :ref:`MIDI-Like` will only represent time signature changes (MIDI messages) as they come. If you want more
            "recalls" of the current time signature within your token sequences, you can preprocess your MIDI file to
            add more ``TimeSignatureChange`` objects. (default: ``False``)
    :param use_sustain_pedals: will use ``Pedal`` tokens to represent the sustain pedal events. In multitrack setting,
            The value of each ``Pedal`` token will be equal to the program of the track. (default: ``False``)
    :param use_pitch_bends: will use ``PitchBend`` tokens. In multitrack setting, a ``Program`` token will be added
            before each ``PitchBend` token. (default: ``False``)
    :param use_pitch_intervals: if given True, will represent the pitch of the notes with pitch intervals tokens.
            This way, successive and simultaneous notes will be represented with respectively ``PitchIntervalTime`` and
            ``PitchIntervalChord`` tokens. A good example is depicted in :ref:`Additional tokens`. This option is to be
            used with the ``max_pitch_interval`` and ``pitch_intervals_max_time_dist`` arguments. (default: False)
    :param use_programs: will use ``Program`` tokens to specify the instrument / MIDI program of the notes, if the
            tokenizer is compatible (:ref:`TSD`, :ref:`REMI`, :ref:`MIDI-Like`, :ref:`Structured` and :ref:`CPWord`).
            Use this parameter with the ``programs``, ``one_token_stream_for_programs`` and `program_changes` arguments.
            By default, it will prepend a ``Program`` tokens before each ``Pitch`` / ``NoteOn`` token to
            indicate its associated instrument, and will treat all the tracks of a MIDI as a single sequence of tokens.
            :ref:`CPWord`, :ref:`Octuple` and :ref:`MuMIDI` add a ``Program`` tokens with the stacks of ``Pitch``,
            ``Velocity`` and ``Duration`` tokens. The :ref:`Octuple`, :ref:`MMM` and :ref:`MuMIDI` tokenizers
            use natively ``Program`` tokens, this option is always enabled. (default: ``False``)
    :param beat_res_rest: the beat resolution of ``Rest`` tokens. It follows the same data pattern as the ``beat_res``
            argument, however the maximum resolution for rests cannot be higher than the highest "global" resolution
            (``beat_res``). Rests are considered complementary to other time tokens (``TimeShift``, ``Bar`` and
            ``Position``). If in a given situation, ``Rest`` tokens cannot represent time with the exact precision,
            other time times will complement them. (default: ``{(0, 1): 8, (1, 2): 4, (2, 12): 2}``)
    :param chord_maps: list of chord maps, to be given as a dictionary where keys are chord qualities
            (e.g. "maj") and values pitch maps as tuples of integers (e.g. ``(0, 4, 7)``).
            You can use ``miditok.constants.CHORD_MAPS`` as an example. (default: ``miditok.constants.CHORD_MAPS``)
    :param chord_tokens_with_root_note: to specify the root note of each chord in ``Chord`` tokens.
            Tokens will look like ``Chord_C:maj``. (default: ``False``)
    :param chord_unknown: range of number of notes to represent unknown chords.
            If you want to represent chords that does not match any combination in ``chord_maps``, use this argument.
            Leave ``None`` to not represent unknown chords. (default: ``None``)
    :param num_tempos: number of tempos "bins" to use. (default: ``32``)
    :param tempo_range: range of minimum and maximum tempos within which the bins fall. (default: ``(40, 250)``)
    :param log_tempos: will use log scaled tempo values instead of linearly scaled. (default: ``False``)
    :param delete_equal_successive_tempo_changes: setting this option True will delete identical successive tempo
            changes when preprocessing a MIDI file after loading it. For examples, if a MIDI has two tempo changes
            for tempo 120 at tick 1000 and the next one is for tempo 121 at tick 1200, during preprocessing the tempo
            values are likely to be downsampled and become identical (120 or 121). If that's the case, the second
            tempo change will be deleted and not tokenized. This parameter doesn't apply for tokenizations that natively
            inject the tempo information at recurrent timings (e.g. :ref:`Octuple`). For others, note that setting it
            True might reduce the number of ``Tempo`` tokens and in turn the recurrence of this information. Leave it
            False if you want to have recurrent ``Tempo`` tokens, that you might inject yourself by adding
            ``TempoChange`` objects to your MIDIs. (default: ``False``)
    :param time_signature_range: range as a dictionary ``{denom_i: [num_i1, ..., num_in] / (min_num_i, max_num_i)}``.
            (default: ``{8: [3, 12, 6], 4: [5, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4]}``)
    :param sustain_pedal_duration: by default, the tokenizer will use ``PedalOff`` tokens to mark the offset times of
            pedals. By setting this parameter True, it will instead use ``Duration`` tokens to explicitly express their
            durations. If you use this parameter, make sure to configure ``beat_res`` to cover the durations you expect.
            (default: ``False``)
    :param pitch_bend_range: range of the pitch bend to consider, to be given as a tuple with the form
            ``(lowest_value, highest_value, num_of_values)``. There will be ``num_of_values`` tokens equally spaced
            between ``lowest_value` and `highest_value``. (default: ``(-8192, 8191, 32)``)
    :param delete_equal_successive_time_sig_changes: setting this option True will delete identical successive time
            signature changes when preprocessing a MIDI file after loading it. For examples, if a MIDI has two time
            signature changes for 4/4 at tick 1000 and the next one is also 4/4 at tick 1200, the second time signature
            change will be deleted and not tokenized. This parameter doesn't apply for tokenizations that natively
            inject the time signature information at recurrent timings (e.g. :ref:`Octuple`). For others, note that
            setting it ``True`` might reduce the number of ``TimeSig`` tokens and in turn the recurrence of this
            information. Leave it ``False`` if you want to have recurrent ``TimeSig`` tokens, that you might inject
            yourself by adding ``TimeSignatureChange`` objects to your MIDIs. (default: ``False``)
    :param programs: sequence of MIDI programs to use. Note that ``-1`` is used and reserved for drums tracks.
            (default: ``list(range(-1, 128))``, from -1 to 127 included)
    :param one_token_stream_for_programs: when using programs (``use_programs``), this parameters will make the
            tokenizer treat all the tracks of a MIDI as a single stream of tokens. A ``Program`` token will prepend each
            ``Pitch``, ``NoteOn`` and ``NoteOff`` tokens to indicate their associated program / instrument. Note that
            this parameter is always set to True for :ref:`MuMIDI` and :ref:`MMM`. Setting it to False will make the
            tokenizer not use ``Programs``, but will allow to still have ``Program`` tokens in the vocabulary.
            (default: ``True``)
    :param program_changes: to be used with ``use_programs``. If given True, the tokenizer will place ``Program``
            tokens whenever a note is being played by an instrument different from the last one. This mimics the
            ProgramChange MIDI messages. If given False, a ``Program`` token will precede each note tokens instead.
            This parameter only apply for :ref:`REMI`, :ref:`TSD` and :ref:`MIDI-Like`. If you set it True while your
            tokenizer is not int ``one_token_stream`` mode, a ``Program`` token at the beginning of each track token
            sequence. (default: ``False``)
    :param max_pitch_interval: sets the maximum pitch interval that can be represented. (default: 16)
    :param pitch_intervals_max_time_dist: sets the default maximum time interval in beats between two consecutive
            notes to be represented with pitch intervals (default: 1)
    :param kwargs: additional parameters that will be saved in ``config.additional_params``.
