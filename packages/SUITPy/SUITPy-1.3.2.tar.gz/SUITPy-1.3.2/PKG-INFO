Description: SUITPy: Analysis and visualization of cerebellar imaging data.
        ==============================================================
        
        The package provides some basic functionality of the original SUIT toolbox for Matlab (https://github.com/jdiedrichsen/suit).
        Currently, only mapping of volume data to the flatmap and display of the flatmap are implemented.
