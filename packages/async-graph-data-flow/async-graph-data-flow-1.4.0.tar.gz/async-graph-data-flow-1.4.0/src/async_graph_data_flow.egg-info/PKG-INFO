## Setting up a Development Environment

The latest code under development is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/civisanalytics/async-graph-data-flow.
To obtain this version for experimental features or for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/civisanalytics/async-graph-data-flow.git
cd async-graph-data-flow
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To run tests and styling checks:

```bash
pytest
flake8 src tests examples
black --check src tests examples
```

## For Maintainers

To update the Sphinx documentation,
the source files that need editing are under `docs/source/`;
everything else under `docs/` is auto-generated.
After the manual updates under `docs/source/` are ready,
the HTML pages are updated as follows:

```bash
rm -r docs/_sources docs/_static && rm docs/*.html

# Run the following command *twice* -- certain HTML updates only show up after multiple `sphinx-build` runs.
sphinx-build docs/source docs
```
