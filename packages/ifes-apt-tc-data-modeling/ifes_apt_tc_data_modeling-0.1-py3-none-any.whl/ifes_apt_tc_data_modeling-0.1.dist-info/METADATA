              other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
              control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
        
              "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity

              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# atomprobe-data-modeling

## Mission:
Foster exchange about data models and work towards specifications
of file formats from the research field of atom probe microscopy.

# Getting started
You should create a virtual environment. We tested on Ubuntu with Python 3.8 and newer version.
In what follows the version (tag) 3.8 is a placeholder whereby we show how to proceed when using
Python 3.8. Using newer versions of Python should work the same by replacing 3.8 with the respective
version (tag).

Older versions of Python like 3.8 and 3.9 are available e.g. via the deadsnakes repository or via
conda. For using deadsnakes proceed with the following commands:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt install python3.8 python3-dev libpython3.8-dev python3.8-venv
```

In some cases when using Python3.8, it was necessary to install python-numpy.
Please consider this if you run into issues when continuing with this manual.
The following steps will install the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling module in the
latest version.

```
mkdir <your-brand-new-folder>
cd <your-brand-new-folder>
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv --python=python3.8 .py38
source .py38/bin/activate

git clone git@github.com:atomprobe-tc/ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling.git
cd ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install pip-tools
python -m pip install -e .
python -m pip list
```

## Additional steps to do when working with jupyter notebooks
By default the functionalities are offered as a library for Python programmers.
For developers and users who would like to try using the library a convenient
way is via jupyter notebooks. You can find instructions about how to use this tool
in the tests/data jupyter notebook. This notebook can be started from the command
line inside the ifes_apt_tc_data_modeling directory simply by calling.
If you would like to use a jupyter notebook jupyter has to be installed as
it will not be installed by default. To achieve this perform the following actions:

```
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pip list

jupyter-lab
```

## Documentation of file formats and data models in atom probe status quo
Detailed technical specifications of the file formats and data models are not available for
most formats in the field of atom probe microscopy. A practical solution to address this 
limitation has been so far that scientists collect example files formatted in respective formats.

These so-called instances were inspected and shared with colleagues. In summary, individual
atom probers have contributed to formulate what can be considered likely candidates
of specifications for several file formats via reverse engineering.
This worked especially well for the POS and ePOS formats.

Pieces of information about file formats were reported in the literature (e.g.
the books by D. Larson et al. and B. Gault et al.). Atom probers like D. Haley have contributed
substantially to make the community aware of existent limitations and these reverse engineering
practices. AMETEK/Cameca is the key technology partner in atom probe. They have developed
an open file format called APT which improves the accessibility of specific numerical data and
some metadata. Individuals like M. Kühbach have driven the implementation and communication of
parsers for this APT file format.

Nowadays there is an increased interest and demand placed on atom probers by the funding agencies
that researchers should or even have to make their research data management and data stewardship
better matching and more completely aligned to the aims and practices of the F.A.I.R.
principles of data stewardship. Therefore, it is useful to exchange more details about
data models and file formats. Otherwise, it is not foreseeable how atom probe data can be made
really interoperable with electronic lab notebooks, research data management
systems (RDMS), and related software tools for data analyses.

In light of these challenges, the idea of understanding formats just by examples, showed to be a
slow and error-prone route as e.g. source code and workflows which have been useed to write such
files, and the associated input, workflow, and provenance information has typically not been captured.
Or the specific software tool(s) used might not have been shared or made accessible for review
by the atom probe community.

## Benefit and Next Steps
You can easily imagine that the more people will support this work the more complete a public
understanding and knowledge about the available file formats in atom probe microscopy will become.
This can help all of us in the long run to build software tools which are more reliable, yield
thrustworthy results and are technically more robust when it comes to parsing research data.
Irrespective from which tools these data and metadata come or how one would like to used these data.

The Python parsers in this repository are meant as a motivation to offer immediate benefit for users.
The collection of examples and technical discussions via issues serves the more long-term aim.
This is to arrive at a detailed technical specification rather than having more robust parsers only
so that atom probe data can be exchanged across tools irrespective of their formatting.

## Support us with this work
Thank you very much for supporting this activity and your time.

## Feedback, questions
Feel free to drop us a message via creating an issue or commenting on one.
Feel invited to use the resources in this repository.

## Where to place your examples?
There is a *examples_with_provenance* and *examples_without_provenance*
sub-directory for each file format.

When you do know with which software and measured dataset you have created a file,
you should share the file and these pieces of information (software version). Do so by
naming at least the respective raw files. Ideally, you share the examples via offering
a link to an external data repository such as Zenodo or other providers. This not only
avoids that this repository would get too much filled up with binary data.
Also it enables you to share clearly under which license you would like make your
example(s) accessible.

## Provenance if possible, plain examples if in doubt
Use the *examples_with_provenance* sub-directory. With this it is at least possible
to reproduce the file creation. A practical solution is to share (by uploading)
the screenshot of the complete IVAS/APSuite version info screen, including
the APSuite version, the CERN Root version, the CamecaRoot version, and the versions
of libraries used by APSuite. This can help other atom probers and AMETEK/Cameca
to improve their software as it will enable them to identify inconsistencies.

Atom probers should be aware that file formats like POS, ePOS, or APT are neither
raw data nor follow a clear technical documentation. Therefore, all current file
formats are not meeting the FAIR principles. Instead, share RRAW, STR, RHIT, and HITS files.
Ideally, you add unique identifiers (such as SHA256 checksums) for each file.
A documentation how you can do this was issued by your IFES APT TC colleagues
[(How to hash your data)](https://github.com/oxfordAPT/hashlist).

If you cannot provide such detailed pieces of information, you can still participate
and support us a lot if you share your knowledge by adding at least a link to a repository
or file share with content in the relevant atom-probe-specific file formats.

In this case, please use the *examples_without_provenance* directory.
While these examples are stripped of the context in which they were created
and used (provenance information), these examples can still be very useful
to run the file formats parsers against to make the parsers more robust, i.e.
that these can pick up formatting issues and act accordingly.

# Background information
File formats, data models, in (almost every) research field may not be fully documented.
A checklist of the necessary pieces of information and documentation required to call a
data model, data schema, and/or file format fully documented in accordance with the
FAIR data and research software stewardship principles is given below:

1. Each piece of information (bit/byte) is documented.
2. This documentation fulfills the FAIR principles, i.e.
   [Wilkinson et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18) and
   [Barker et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x)
   For binary files, tools like [kaitai struct](https://kaitai.io/) offer a
   solution to describe the exact binary information content in a data
   item. This can be a file but also the storage of a database entry or the
   response of a call to an API.
   Let alone the binary structure is insufficient tough.
3. To each piece of information there has to exist also a parameterized description,
   what this piece of information conceptually means. One way to arrive at such
   description is to use a data schema or ontology.
   It is important to mention that the concepts in this schema/ontology have
   unique identifier so that each data item/piece of information is identifiable
   as an instance of an entry in a database or a knowledge graph.
   This holds independently of which research data management system
   or electronic lab notebook is used.
4. In addition, it is very useful if timestamps are associated with each data item
   (ISO8061 including time zone information) so that it is possible to create a
   timeline of the context in which and when the e.g. file was created.

The first and second point is known as a specification, while the third and fourth
point emphasize that the contextualization and provenance is key to make a
specification complete and useful.
