              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

## Project Goal <a name="project-goal"></a>

LeapfrogAI is designed to provide AI-as-a-service in egress limited environments. This project aims to bridge the gap between resource-constrained environments and the growing demand for sophisticated AI solutions, by enabling the hosting of APIs that provide AI-related services.

Our services include vector databases, completions with models like Large Language Models (LLMs), and the creation of embeddings. These AI capabilities can be easily accessed and integrated with your existing infrastructure, ensuring the power of AI can be harnessed irrespective of your environment's limitations.

## Why Host Your Own LLM? <a name="why-host-your-own-llm"></a>

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful resource for AI-driven decision making, content generation, and more. However, the use of cloud-based LLMs can introduce limitations such as:

* **Data Privacy and Security**: Sending sensitive information to a third-party service may not be suitable or permissible for all types of data or organizations. By hosting your own LLM, you retain full control over your data.

* **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go AI services can become expensive, especially when large volumes of data are involved. Running your own LLM can often be a more cost-effective solution in the long run.

* **Customization and Control**: By hosting your own LLM, you have the ability to customize the model's parameters, training data, and more, tailoring the AI to your specific needs.

* **Latency**: If your application requires real-time or near-real-time responses, hosting the model locally can significantly reduce latency compared to making a round trip to a remote API.

## Features <a name="features"></a>

* LeapfrogAI provides an API that closely matches that of OpenAI's. This feature allows tools that have been built with OpenAI/ChatGPT to function seamlessly with LeapfrogAI as a backend. This compatibility greatly simplifies the transition process for developers familiar with OpenAI's API, and facilitates easy integration with existing systems.

* Vector Databases: Our vector database service allows you to perform efficient similarity searches on large scale databases. This feature can be utilized to augment prompts with responses from VectorDBs, enhancing the contextual awareness of the model.

* Fine-Tuning Models: One of the key strengths of LeapfrogAI is its ability to leverage customer specific data. We provide capabilities to fine-tune models with your data, enabling the AI to better understand your domain and provide more accurate and contextually relevant outputs.

* Embeddings Creation: Embeddings are fundamental to the working of many AI algorithms. LeapfrogAI provides services to generate embeddings which can be used for a variety of tasks such as semantic similarity, clustering, and more.

## Architecture

Leapfrog exposes both Weaviate and LLM and embedding generative capabilities over HTTP.  However, internal communications are a combination of gRPC and HTTP connections as described below:

```mermaid
graph LR;
    A[User] --HTTP--> L[LeapfrogAI]
    L ---->|HTTP| B(API)
    B ----> |gRPC| C(StableLM)
    B ----> |gRPC| D(WhisperAI)
    B ----> |gRPC| E(all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

    L ---->|HTTP| W[Weaviate]

```

## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Setting up the Kubernetes Cluster

LeapfrogAI's API server and [weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)'s vector database don't require GPUs, however some models will not function without GPUs.  If using a CPU based platform, see the [ctransformers](./models/llms/ctransformers/) folder for working with GGML architectures.

#### K3d w/ GPU support

If developing on a node that has a GPU, there's a Zarf package that deploys a k3d cluster with GPU support clone and follow the instructions in the repository [here](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf-package-k3d-airgap).

on a node with at least 1 GPU

#### Initialize Cluster

The supported install method uses [zarf](https://zarf.dev) to initialize the cluster and then deploy [Big Bang](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-package-dubbd) on top:

```shell
zarf init -a amd64
zarf package deploy oci://ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/packages/dubbd-k3d:0.11.0-amd64 --set APPROVED_REGISTRIES="ghcr.io/runyontr/* | ghcr.io/defenseunicorns/* | nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/* | semitechnologies/*"
```


### Deploy

To build and deploy Leapfrg

```shell
zarf package create .
zarf package deploy zarf-package-leapfrogai-*.zst --confirm
```

### Configure DNS

Ensure that the DNS record for `*.bigbang.dev` points to the load balancer for Istio.  By default this DNS record points at localhost, so for the k3d deployment, this should work out of the box with the load balancers configured.


The OpenAI API service is hosted and is watching for new models to get installed in the cluster.

### Install a model

```shell
$ cd models/test/repeater
$ zarf package create .
$ zarf package deploy zarf-package-*.zst --confirm
$ kubectl get pods -n leapfrogai
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
api-deployment-65cd6fbf95-l5dzw   2/2     Running   0          5m23s
```


## Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Reference one of the ipythonnotebooks that showcase a simple getting started.


# Leapfrog AI

Leapfrog AI is a deployable AI-as-a-service that brings the capabilities of AI models to egress limited environments by allowing teams to deploy APIs that mirror OpenAI's spec.  Teams are able to use tools built around OpenAIs models in their own environment, preventing the release of proprietary and sensitive data to SaaS tools.

In addition, tools like [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) are deployed to allow for the creation of content augmented applications.


## Create the API Server

See the [Getting Started Notebook](notebooks/gettingstarted.ipynb) for example of using the API with the OpenAI python module.


# Building `leapfrogai` and updating PyPi

1. Change the version in `pyproject.toml`
2. `python3 -m pip install --upgrade build hatchling twine`
3. `python3 -m build`
4. `python3 -m twine upload dist/*`


# Community

Real-time discussions about LeapfrogAI development happen in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/leapfrog). Discussions should be civil and focused on the open source development of LeapfrogAI.
