# TOPSIS ranking and interpretation using WMSD-space
![](https://github.com/dabrze/topsis-msd-improvement-actions/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This repository hosts the code for **MSDTransformer** - a scikit-learn compatible python library, that lets you create TOPSIS rankings of alternatives, visualize rankings in WMSD space, and get suggestions for improvement actions. 
<!-- Check out the project's [documentation](https://msdtransformer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to learn more about using the MSDTransformer.  -->

## Requirements

MSDTransformer uses PySCIPOpt to determine exact WMSD boundaries quickly. If you use conda, you should be fine performing the follwoing command (easier option):
```console
conda install --channel conda-forge pyscipopt
``` 
If you use PyPI, then you will need a working installation of the [SCIP Optimization
Suite](https://www.scipopt.org/) (harder option, but might run faster). Please, make sure that your SCIP installation works, before installing MSDTransformer. For more details on how to install SCIP, please refer to the [PySCIPOpt documentation](https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

After installing PySCIPOpt (or if you already have SCIP installed), you can install the other dependencies by running:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Installation

<!-- ### From PyPI

This is the simplest (one-command) install method is to run the following command in your terminal:

```console
pip install MSDtransformer
```

### From source -->

Once you have all the dependencies, you can install MSDTransformer from source. To do so, clone the repository and run the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```console
pip install .
```

## Quickstart

```python
import pandas as pd
from MSDTransformer import MSDTransformer

df = pd.read_csv("../data/students.csv", sep=';', index_col= 0)
students_transformer = MSDTransformer("R") # Relative distance
students_transformer.fit(df, expert_range=[[0,100],[1,6],[1,6]])
students_transformer.transform(df)
```

![Transformed data frame](notebooks/figures/quickstart_transform.png)

```python
students_transformer.show_ranking()
```

![Ranking](./notebooks/figures/quickstart_ranking.png)

```python
students_transformer.plot()
```
