    copies of it are linked to the same program. This environment variable is a `workaround` to allow the program to
    continue to execute. **Note** this can be dangerous according to the error raised by OpenMP which states the
    following: "That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results ...
    [setting KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=True] may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results". But from my testing
    it hasn't caused any of the aforementioned possible complications.
