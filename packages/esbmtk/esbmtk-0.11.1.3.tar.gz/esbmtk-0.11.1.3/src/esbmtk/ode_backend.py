        We need to consider 3 types of reservoirs:

        1) Reservoirs that change as a result of physical fluxes i.e.
        r.lof > 0.  These require a flux statements and a reservoir
        equation.

        2) Reservoirs that do not have active fluxes but are computed
        as a tracer, i.e.. HCO3.  These only require a reservoir
        equation

        3) Reservoirs that do not change but are used as input.  Those
        should not happen in a well formed model, but we cannot
        exclude the possibility.  In this case, there is no flux
        equation, and we state that dR/dt = 0

        get_ic() will look up the index position of the
        reservoir_handle on icl, and then use this index to retrieve
        the correspinding value in R
