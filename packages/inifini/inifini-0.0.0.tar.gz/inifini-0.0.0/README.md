# inifini
[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/inifini)
](https://pypi.org/project/inifini/)

A Python multipurpose framework for building any web-server

> Nothing is done yet

## Installation

```bash
pip install inifini
```

## Reason for this Framework

Developing a web-server should be fun

### Story

I was trying to develop something with Flask (came first to my mind)
but I needed a background-worker which collided Flasks reloading system.
Like a normal programmer, instead of searching for an alternative framework
I just decided to make my own.
<small>And I also didn't need the template-engine as the frontend would
be developed with a proper web-framework like react</small>
