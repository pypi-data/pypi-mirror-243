## Installation

Open your **Terminal** or **Command Prompt** app and enter one of the installation commands below.

### With Pipx

For the **easiest** installation, install with [Pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/): 

    pipx install academic

Pipx will **automatically install the required Python version for you** in a dedicated environment.

### With Pip

 To install using the Python's Pip tool, ensure you have [Python 3.11+](https://realpython.com/installing-python/) installed and then run:

    pip3 install -U academic

## Usage

Open your Command Line or Terminal app and use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder containing the files you wish to convert, for example:

    cd ~/Documents/my_website

### Import publications

Download references from your reference manager, such as Zotero, in the Bibtex format.

Say we downloaded our publications to a file named `my_publications.bib` within the website folder, let's import them into the `content/publication/` folder:

    academic import my_publications.bib content/publication/ --compact

Optional arguments:

* `--compact` Generate minimal markdown without comments or empty keys
* `--overwrite` Overwrite any existing publications in the output folder
* `--normalize` Normalize tags by converting them to lowercase and capitalizing the first letter (e.g. "sciEnCE" -> "Science")
* `--featured` Flag these publications as *featured* (to appear in your website's *Featured Publications* section)
* `--verbose` or `-v` Show verbose messages
* `--help` Help

### Import full text and cover image

After importing publications, we suggest you:
- Edit the Markdown body of each publication to add the full text directly to the page (if the publication is open access), or otherwise, to add supplementary notes for each publication
- Add an image named `featured` to each publication's folder to visually represent your publication on the page and for sharing on social media
- Add the publication PDF to each publication folder (for open access publications), to enable your website visitors to download your publication
  
[Learn more in the Hugo Blox Docs](https://docs.hugoblox.com/reference/content-types/).

### Import blog posts from Jupyter Notebooks

Say we have our notebooks in a `notebooks` folder within the website folder, let's import them into the `content/post/` folder:

    academic import 'notebooks/*.ipynb' content/post/ --verbose

Optional arguments:

* `--overwrite` Overwrite any existing blog posts in the output folder
* `--verbose` or `-v` Show verbose messages
* `--help` Help
