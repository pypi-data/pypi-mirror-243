PyLabel is a Python package to help you prepare image datasets for computer vision models including PyTorch and YOLOv5. It can translate bounding box annotations between different formats. (For example, COCO to YOLO.) And it includes an AI-assisted labeling tool that runs in a Jupyter notebook. 

-	**Translate:** Convert annotation formats with a single line of code: 
    ```
    importer.ImportCoco(path_to_annotations).export.ExportToYoloV5()
    ```
-	**Analyze:** PyLabel stores annotatations in a pandas dataframe so you can easily perform analysis on image datasets. 
-	**Split:** Divide image datasets into train, test, and val with stratification to get consistent class distribution.  <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pylabel-project/datasets_models/main/pylabel_assets/train_test_split.png" width=400>
-  **Label:** PyLabel also includes an image labeling tool that runs in a Jupyter notebook that can annotate images manually or perform automatic labeling using a pre-trained model.<br><br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pylabel-project/datasets_models/main/pylabel_assets/pylaber_screenshot.png" width=400>
-	**Visualize:** Render images from your dataset with bounding boxes overlaid so you can confirm the accuracy of the annotations.
