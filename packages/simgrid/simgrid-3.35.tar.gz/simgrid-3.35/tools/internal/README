This directory contains some tools that we use to build and maintain SimGrid itself. I doubt that any of them are useful
out of that context, but you are welcome to dig and inspect everything you want.

They are not included in the archive and are thus not mandatory to use SimGrid.

These little codes are under the same licence than SimGrid itself.
