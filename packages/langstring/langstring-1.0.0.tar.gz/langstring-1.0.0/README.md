## LangString Overview

**LangString** is a powerful Python library inspired by the RDF's idea of language tagging. It offers a streamlined approach to handle multilingual data in Python.

### Benefits of LangStrings

- **Context**: Knowing the language of a text is crucial for processing and presentation.

- **User Experience**: For apps with global users, displaying data in a user's language improves their experience. LangStrings make this process efficient.

- **Data Consistency**: With LangStrings, multilingual data has a standard format, reducing complexity.

- **Tailored Operations**: Having the language info allows for specialized actions, especially in fields like NLP.

### Practical Use of LangStrings

Consider the value of LangStrings in real-world scenarios:

- **Greeting Users**:

```python
# English vs Japanese greeting
greeting_en = LangString(text="Hello", lang="en")
greeting_ja = LangString(text="„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ", lang="ja")

print(greeting_en.to_string())  # "Hello"@en
print(greeting_ja.to_string())  # "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ"@ja
```

- **Multilingual Product Names**:

```python
# Eiffel Tower in English and French
eiffel_en = LangString(text="Eiffel Tower", lang="en")
eiffel_fr = LangString(text="Tour Eiffel", lang="fr")

print(eiffel_en.to_string())  # "Eiffel Tower"@en
print(eiffel_fr.to_string())  # "Tour Eiffel"@fr
```

### LangString Class - Usage Examples

The `LangString` class in the `langstring_lib` module encapsulates a string with its associated language information.

1. Initialization

```python
# Create a LangString object with only text
simple_string = LangString("Hello, world!")

# Create a LangString object with text and language information
english_greeting = LangString("Hello, world!", "en")
```

If an invalid language tag is used or non-string type is provided, appropriate warnings and errors will be raised:

```python
# This will log a warning because 'invalid-lang' is not a valid language tag
invalid_lang = LangString("Hello, world!", "invalid-lang")

# This will raise a TypeError since the text is not a string
try:
    invalid_text_type = LangString(12345)
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")  # Outputs an error message if the input is not a string
```

2. Converting the LangString Object to String

The `LangString` class provides two methods to convert the object into its string representation, `to_string()` and `__str__()`:

```python
english_greeting = LangString("Hello, world!", "en")

# Using the to_string() method
print(english_greeting.to_string())  # Outputs: "Hello, world!"@en

# Using the __str__() method (which is implicitly called when using Python's built-in str() function)
print(str(english_greeting))  # Outputs: "Hello, world!"@en
```

The string representation will include the text encapsulated in double quotes. If a language is associated with the text, it will be appended after the text, preceded by an "@" symbol.

## MultiLangString: Handling Multiple Translations

While `LangString` manages one string-language pair, `MultiLangString` holds several translations of a string. This is useful for keeping various translations of a term within one object.

For instance, if you have a product with multiple language names:

```python
from langstring import MultiLangString

product_names = MultiLangString({
    "en": "Smartphone",
    "fr": "Smartphone",
    "es": "Tel√©fono inteligente",
    "de": "Smartphone"
})

print(product_names.get_lang("es"))  # Tel√©fono inteligente
```

### MultiLangString Control Options

`MultiLangString` provides granular controls for handling situations where there are multiple entries with the same language tag. This behavior is defined by the `MULTIPLE_ENTRIES_CONTROLS` configuration.

#### Available Controls

1. **`ALLOW`**:
    - **Description**: Permits multiple entries with the same language tag. However, it ensures that no duplicate texts for the same language tag are added.
    - **Usage**: Beneficial in situations where multiple translations or interpretations of a term in the same language are valid.

2. **`OVERWRITE`**:
    - **Description**: If an entry with the same language tag already exists, this control will overwrite the existing entry with the new value.
    - **Usage**: Useful in scenarios where you want to ensure that there's only one entry per language and are okay with updating existing values.

3. **`BLOCK_WARN`**:
    - **Description**: Blocks the addition of a `LangString` if a matching language tag already exists and logs a warning.
    - **Usage**: Recommended for cases where you want to prevent duplicate entries but only want a log warning instead of a halt in operations.

4. **`BLOCK_ERROR`**:
    - **Description**: Blocks the addition of a `LangString` if a matching language tag is present and raises an error.
    - **Usage**: Useful when ensuring data integrity is paramount, and you want to halt the operation if a duplicate entry is encountered.

When setting the `control` property of a `MultiLangString` instance, it is essential to provide a valid control strategy. If an invalid strategy is supplied, the system will raise a `ValueError` highlighting the acceptable control values.

To utilize these controls, configure the desired behavior when initializing the `MultiLangString` object or updating its entries.

### Usage Examples for the MultiLangString Class

1. Initialization

You can initialize a `MultiLangString` object by passing in multiple `LangString` objects and specifying control and preferred language properties:

```python
from langstring import LangString, MultiLangString

english_greeting = LangString("Hello", "en")
french_greeting = LangString("Bonjour", "fr")

# Initializing MultiLangString with two LangString objects
multi_lang_str = MultiLangString(english_greeting, french_greeting, control="ALLOW", preferred_lang="en")
```

2. Add Method

Use the `add` method to add a new `LangString` object to the `MultiLangString`:

```python
lang_str3 = LangString("Hola", "es")
multi_lang_str.add(lang_str3)
```

3. Getting a Specific Language String

To retrieve a language string for a specific language:

```python
english_strings = multi_lang_str.get_langstring("en")  # Returns list of English strings
```

4. Getting the Preferred Language String

Retrieve the language string for the preferred language:

```python
preferred_string = multi_lang_str.get_pref_langstring()  # Returns the string for the preferred language
```

5. Removing a Specific LangString

Remove a specific `LangString` object from the `MultiLangString`:

```python
multi_lang_str.remove_langstring(lang_str3)  # Removes the Spanish string
```

6. Removing All Strings for a Specific Language

Remove all `LangString` objects associated with a specific language:

```python
multi_lang_str.remove_language("es")  # Removes all Spanish strings
```

7. Converting to String

You can convert a `MultiLangString` object to a string representation:

```python
str_representation = multi_lang_str.to_string()
print(str_representation)  # Outputs: '"Hello"@en, "Bonjour"@fr'
```

8. Converting to List of Strings

Convert the `MultiLangString` to a list of strings:

```python
list_representation = multi_lang_str.to_string_list()
print(list_representation)  # Outputs: ['"Hello"@en', '"Bonjour"@fr']
```

9. Getting the Length

Determine the number of `LangString` objects in a `MultiLangString`:

```python
length = len(multi_lang_str)  # Outputs: 2
```

10. String Representation

"Obtain a user-friendly string representation of the `MultiLangString`. This representation is ideal for displaying the content of the `MultiLangString` object in a readable format, suitable for user interfaces or textual outputs. The `str()` method is used to achieve this."

```python
print(str(multi_lang_str))  # Outputs: '"Hello"@en, "Bonjour"@fr'

```

11. Representation Method

Use the `repr()` method to get a formal, detailed string representation of the `MultiLangString` object. This output is more technical, showing the exact state of the object, which is particularly useful for debugging and development purposes. It provides a clear view of the internal structure and data of the `MultiLangString`."

```python
print(repr(multi_lang_str))  # Outputs a detailed, technical representation of the object
```

This is useful for understanding the current state of a `MultiLangString` object.

Remember, the `MultiLangString` class is designed to handle multiple language strings, allowing you to manage multilingual text strings effectively and efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install with:

```bash
pip install langstring
```

Then, encapsulate strings with their language tags as shown in the examples above.

### Importing and Using the Library

After installation, you can use the `LangString` and `MultiLangString` classes in your project. Simply import the classes and start encapsulating strings with their language tags.

```python
from langstring import LangString, MultiLangString
```

#### Example Usage of `LangString`

```python
# Creating a LangString object for an English greeting
greeting_en = LangString("Hello", "en")

# Printing the LangString object, which shows the text and its language tag
print(greeting_en)  # Output: "Hello"@en
```

#### Example Usage of `MultiLangString`

```python
# Create LangString objects for greetings in English and Spanish
greeting_en = LangString("Hello", "en")
greeting_es = LangString("Hola", "es")

# Use MultiLangString to combine them. The 'control' parameter determines how duplicate language tags are handled.
combined_greeting = MultiLangString(greeting_en, greeting_es, control="ALLOW")

# Fetch and print a greeting based on language
# Note: The `get_langstring` method returns a list, so we'll take the first item if available
spanish_greetings = combined_greeting.get_langstring("es")
if spanish_greetings:
    print(spanish_greetings[0])  # Outputs: "Hola"@es
else:
    print("No greeting found for the specified language.")

# Retrieve the preferred language's greeting (defaults to English in this example)
preferred_greeting = combined_greeting.get_pref_langstring()
if preferred_greeting:
    print(preferred_greeting)  # Outputs: "Hello"@en
else:
    print("No greeting found for the preferred language.")
```

### Comparison and Hashing

Both the `LangString` and the `MultiLangString` classes support comparison and hashing operations, making it easier to compare and manage these objects in data structures like sets and dictionaries.

#### LangString

##### Equality and Inequality

- `__eq__`: Checks if two `LangString` objects are equal (both `text` and `lang` attributes are the same).
- `__ne__`: Checks if two `LangString` objects are not equal.

```python
from langstring import LangString

ls1 = LangString("Hello", "en")
ls2 = LangString("Hello", "en")
ls3 = LangString("Hola", "es")

# Equality
print(ls1 == ls2)  # Output: True
print(ls1 == ls3)  # Output: False

# Inequality
print(ls1 != ls2)  # Output: False
print(ls1 != ls3)  # Output: True
```

##### Hashing

- `__hash__`: Generates a hash value for a `LangString` object, allowing it to be used in sets and as dictionary keys.

```python
from langstring import LangString

ls1 = LangString("Hello", "en")
ls2 = LangString("Hello", "en")
ls3 = LangString("Hola", "es")

# Using LangString objects in a set
lang_strings = {ls1, ls2, ls3}
print(len(lang_strings))  # Output: 2 (since ls1 and ls2 are equal)

# Using LangString as dictionary keys
lang_dict = {ls1: "Greeting in English", ls3: "Greeting in Spanish"}
print(lang_dict[ls1])  # Output: "Greeting in English"
```

#### MultiLangString

##### Equality and Inequality

- `__eq__`: Checks if two `MultiLangString` objects are equal. Equality is determined based on the content of the `langstrings` attribute, which holds the multilingual data. The `preferred_lang` and `control` attributes are not considered in this comparison.

```python
from multilangstring import MultiLangString, LangString

mls1 = MultiLangString(LangString("Hello", "en"), LangString("Hola", "es"))
mls2 = MultiLangString(LangString("Hello", "en"), LangString("Hola", "es"))
mls3 = MultiLangString(LangString("Bonjour", "fr"))

# Equality
print(mls1 == mls2)  # Output: True
print(mls1 == mls3)  # Output: False
```

##### Hashing

- `__hash__`: Generates a hash value for a `MultiLangString` object, allowing it to be used in sets and as dictionary keys. The hash is computed based on the `langstrings` attribute.

```python
from multilangstring import MultiLangString, LangString

mls1 = MultiLangString(LangString("Hello", "en"), LangString("Hola", "es"))
mls2 = MultiLangString(LangString("Hello", "en"), LangString("Hola", "es"))
mls3 = MultiLangString(LangString("Bonjour", "fr"))

# Using MultiLangString objects in a set
multi_lang_strings = {mls1, mls2, mls3}
print(len(multi_lang_strings))  # Output: 2 (since mls1 and mls2 are equal)

# Using MultiLangString as dictionary keys
multi_lang_dict = {mls1: "Greetings in English and Spanish", mls3: "Greeting in French"}
print(multi_lang_dict[mls1])  # Output: "Greetings in English and Spanish"
```
