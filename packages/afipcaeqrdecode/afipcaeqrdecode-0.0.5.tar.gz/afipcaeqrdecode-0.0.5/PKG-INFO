# AFIP invoice pdf qr CAE extract and decode

This is a python package that uses [PyMuPDF](https://pypi.org/project/PyMuPDF/) to dump images from your pdf invoices with an AFIP CAE QR code, and decodes them using [qreader](https://pypi.org/project/qreader/) in order to extract relevant invoice metadata like:

- Invoice date
- CUIT of invoice creator
- AFIP electronic invoice point of sale (Punto de venta)
- Invoice number
- Amount
- Currency
- CUIT of inovoice recipient

And other less important properties.

## Why qreader instead of plain pyzbar

This library used just [pyzbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/) in its inception, however we came upon some QR codes that simply did not decode succesfully using just [pyzbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/).

[qreader](https://pypi.org/project/qreader/) depends on [pyzbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/), but uses a pre-trained AI model to detect and segment QR codes, using information extracted by this AI model, it applies different image preprocessing techniques that heavily increase the decoding rate by [pyzbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/)

## Example Usage

Using the included sample files for demonstration (and ran from repository root using included sample file):

```
from afipcaeqrdecode import extract_qr_cae_from_invoice_pdf_and_decode

invoice_metadata = extract_qr_cae_from_invoice_pdf_and_decode('./tests/sample_files/2000005044986390.pdf')
```

Here, invoice metadata will evaluate to:

```python
{
    "ver":1,
    "fecha":"2023-02-10",
    "cuit":30710145764,
    "ptoVta":4,
    "tipoCmp":1,
    "nroCmp":25399,
    "importe":2460,
    "moneda":"PES",
    "ctz":1,
    "tipoDocRec":80,
    "nroDocRec":30717336905,
    "tipoCodAut":"E",
    "codAut":73064176949471
}

#The actual output will not be pretty printed, it will be stripped of all whitespace and formatting characters
```

## System Dependencies and their installation

This package depends on [qreader](https://pypi.org/project/qreader/), which in turn depends on [pyzbar](https://pypi.org/project/pyzbar/), which in turn depends on the system library zbar [ZBar](https://zbar.sourceforge.net/)

Check your OS documentation on what package to install to get ZBar working with pyzbar.

On Linux (Ubuntu 22.04):

`sudo apt-get install libzbar0`


On Mac OS X:

`brew install zbar`

## Installation using pip

After installing system dependencies, you can install using the [PyPI python package](https://pypi.org/project/afipcaeqrdecode/)

`pip install afipcaeqrdecode`

## First run notice

On first run [qreader](https://pypi.org/project/qreader/) will download the weights to run its QR detector AI model, then it will resume program operation automatically.

## How does it work

It dumps every image of the PDF invoice and then matches it with the format of the URL link that an AFIP CAE QR returns, if it matches it decodes it using `jwt.utils.base64url_decode`. If an invoice has more than one CAE QR code it will return the first one that decodes succesfully.

## WARNING

This is an experimental package, USE IN PRODUCTION AT YOUR OWN RISK.

It is barely even tested, i'm sharing it so I can actually import it as a PyPI package in another project that consumes it.
