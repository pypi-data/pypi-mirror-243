# ImageJointer

Build up image by jointing images

## install 
```
pip install image_jointer
```

## how to use

```python
    from image_jointer import JointAlign, ImageJointer
    from PIL import Image
    
    red = Image.new("RGBA", (100, 100), (255, 0, 0))
    green = Image.new("RGBA", (100, 100), (0, 255, 0))
    blue = Image.new("RGBA", (100, 100), (0, 0, 255))

    jointed = (
        ImageJointer(red)
        .joint(green, JointAlign.SIDE_CENTER)
        .joint(
            ImageJointer(blue).joint(blue, JointAlign.SIDE_CENTER),
            JointAlign.UNDER_LEFT
        )
    )
    joint_img = jointed.to_image()
```

    blank = Blank(50, 100)
    green = Image.new("RGBA", (100, 100), (0, 255, 0))
