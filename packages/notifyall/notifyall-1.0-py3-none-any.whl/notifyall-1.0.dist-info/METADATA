## Quick Start

Here's a quick example of how to send a notification using NotifyAll:


# Initialize the notifier
```python
from notifyall import NotifyAll
from notifyall.params import TelegramParams

# Initialize the notifier
notifier = NotifyAll(config_file='path/to/config.yaml')

```


# Send notification
```python
# Prepare parameters for the Telegram notification
params = TelegramParams(chat_id="123456789")

# Send a notification
notifier.send("Hello from NotifyAll!", params)

The TelegramParams class is used to specify parameters for the Telegram notifier.
