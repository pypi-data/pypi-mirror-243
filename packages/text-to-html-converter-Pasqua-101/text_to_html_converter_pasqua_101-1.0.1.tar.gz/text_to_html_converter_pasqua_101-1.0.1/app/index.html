    <h1>TIL Blog Home Page</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my personal TIL blog! This was created as a way to show off some of the html files my
        <a href="https://github.com/Pasqua101/txt-to-HTML-converter/tree/main">txt to html conversion tool</a> made.
        However, instead of creating some sample txt files, I wrote TIL blog posts which you can find below.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="TIL%20How%20to%20Get%20Command%20Line%20Arguments%20in%20Python.html"> TIL Getting Command Line Arguments In Python</a> </li>
            <br>
            <li> <a href="TIL%20rmtree%20and%20os%20Library.html">TIL How to use rmtree and os Library in Python</a> </li>
