# ChatMOF : An Autonomous AI System for Predicting and Generating Metal-Organic Frameworks

ChatMOF is an autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that is built to predict and generate of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). By leveraging a large-scale language model (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-turbo), ChatMOF extracts key details from textual inputs and delivers appropriate responses, thus eliminating the necessity for rigid structured queries. The system is comprised of  three core components (i.e. an agent, a toolkit, and an evaluator) and it forms a robust pipeline that manages a variety of tasks, including data retrieval, property prediction, and structure generation. The study further explores the merits and constraints of using large language models (LLMs) AI system in material sciences using and showcases its transformative potential for future advancements.

NOTE: We've resolved the unavailability issue, if you run into any further issues please leave a github issue.

## Online Demo
You can test ChatMOF in [Online-Demo](https://chatmof-online.streamlit.app/) site. It requires an `OpenAI key` (For more information, visit the [OpenAI site](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)). In online demo, only the Search task is available. For prediction tasks and generation tasks that require machine learning do not work properly, except for the provided examples.

## Install

### Dependencies

NOTE: This package is primarily tested on Linux. We strongly recommend using Linux for the installation.

```
python>=3.9
```

### Installation

```bash
$ pip install chatmof
```
If you have a dependency issues between `torch` and `moftransformer`, uninstall `torch` and `pytorch-lightning`, install `torch <2.0.0`, and reinstall.

For prediction and generation task, you have to setup modules.

```bash
$ chatmof setup
```

Add the following line to `.bashrc` for the openai api key.
```shell
# openai api key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="enter_your_api_key"
```

If you want to search the internet, you'll need to enter the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` into `.bashrc`.
```shell
# google api and cse_id
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="enter_your_api_key"
export GOOGLE_CSE_ID="enter_your_id"
```

For MOF generation, you need to install GRIDAY.

```bash
$ chatmof install-griday
```

## How to use ChatMOF
You can use it by running chatmof's `run` function.

```bash
$ chatmof run
```
![example](figures/example.JPG)

You can adjust argument of Chatmof such as model and temperature.

```bash
$ chatmof run --model-name gpt-3.5-turbo --temperature 0.5
```

You can use `help` to see more options.

```bash
$ chatmof run --help
```


## Example of ChatMOF
### 1) Search task

## Architecture

ChatMOF comprises three core components: an agent, toolkits, and an evaluator. Upon receiving a query from human, the agent formulates a plan and selects a suitable toolkit. Subsequently, the toolkit generates outputs following the proposed plan, and the evaluator makes these results into a final response.
