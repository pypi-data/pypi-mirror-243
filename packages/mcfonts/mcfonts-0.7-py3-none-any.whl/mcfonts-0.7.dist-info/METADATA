## üì¶ Installation

`mcfonts` is available on PyPI.
It requires a Python version of **at least 3.11.0.**

To install `mcfonts` with pip, run:
```shell
python -m pip install mcfonts
```

If you would like the ability to generate documentation alongside it, run:
```shell
python -m pip install mcfonts[docs]
```

### "externally-managed-environment"

This error occurs on some Linux distributions, such as Fedora 38 and Ubuntu 23.04.
It can be solved by either:

1. Using a [virtual environment (venv)](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment)
2. Using [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

### Dependencies

* [tinyunicodeblock](https://pypi.org/project/tinyunicodeblock/): for font coverage summaries
* [jsonschema](https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema): for the font JSON validation
* [unirange](https://pypi.org/project/unirange/): for special unirange shortcuts

#### Optional dependencies

`docs`: Generating documentation
* [sphinx](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx/): for generating documentation
* [sphinx-autoapi](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autoapi/): for generating code documentation

## üßÆ Features

* handles these providers:
    * `space`
    * `bitmap`
    * `legacy_unicode`
    * `ttf`
    * `unihex`
    * `reference`
* warns of invalid data
* finds oversights that the Vanilla client does not notice
* generates optimized and space-saving glyph paths
* works with any font, not just Vanilla
* works on fonts with double, triple, or higher scales
* generates summaries of fonts
* allows easy inspection of a font's details
* contains glyph utilities and compacting functions
* works on new 1.20+ `unihex` and `reference` providers
* exports in 3 different formats

---

## üõ† Usage

Using `mcfonts` is simple.

```python
import mcfonts

font = mcfonts.from_java_font_file("path/to/font.json")
# Do stuff with `font`...
```

### Exporting

You can easily export to other formats.
Currently, there are 3 supported:

* OpenType
* YAFF
* Unihex

```python
import mcfonts

font = mcfonts.from_java_font_file("path/to/font.json")
exported = font.export(
  mcfonts.export_formats.<format name>,
  {
    "name": "My cool font"
  }
)
```
That's it. You can write the result of `font.export -> bytes` to any file to save it.

If you have a font with ~200 characters, it exports in ~0.3 seconds.
<br/>
If you have a font with ~2,000 characters, it exports in ~3.2 seconds.
<br/>
If you have a font with ~13,000 characters, it exports in ~9.9 seconds.
<br/>
If you have a font with ~60,000 characters, you've made a mistake.
<small>(your font exports in about 1 minute, 15 seconds.)</small>

## ‚ùì Why?
### ‚è≥ It's fast

In the time it has taken you to read this sentence,
a font with 1,000 glyphs has already been generated.

A 13,000-glyph font takes 10 seconds.

A simple 100 glyph font? A fraction of a second; it takes 0.1s.

### ‚ûø It's versatile

`mcfonts` works on fonts of any height, ascent, and size.

It correctly compensates and warns about oversized characters,
translucent textures, and invalid data.

### üß† It makes sense

Fonts are organized by a class.

Providers, too, have their own classes.

Exporting and compacting are separated into their own functions, which makes debugging and modification easy.

> **`mcfonts` does not fix mistakes in fonts.**

It will extrapolate missing data, but empty or corrupt textures, invalid numbers,
or extreme cases will result in an error when trying to create a `MinecraftFont` instance with them.

This gives you the ability to correct these problems instead of silently making them work
(sometimes with limited effectiveness) and keeping you in the dark about future issues.

### üìú It's documented

`mcfonts` has extensive documentation, both externally and in the source code.
Functions are carefully written with rST-style docstrings,
and module variables are given precise descriptions.

---

## üìí Documentation

Documentation for `mcfonts` is available at https://mcfonts.readthedocs.io.

### Building locally
You can build the documentation yourself by grabbing a copy of the source code:

```shell
git clone https://gitlab.com/whoatemybutter/mcfonts.git
cd mcfonts/docs
```

The documentation has a few requirements; install them all with:
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run `make html` to begin building the documentation.
It will be at `_build/html/index.html`.
