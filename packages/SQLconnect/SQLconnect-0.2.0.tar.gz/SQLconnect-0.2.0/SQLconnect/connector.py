"""
This module provides the SQLconnector class for managing SQL database connections and operations.

The SQLconnector class in this module is designed to aid database interactions using SQLAlchemy. 
It includes methods for establishing database connections, executing SQL queries and commands, 
and retrieving query results as pandas DataFrames. The class can be configured using either a 
configuration file or a dictionary.

Classes:
    SQLconnector: A class to handle SQL database connections and operations.

Dependencies:
    - pandas: Used for handling query results as DataFrames.
    - sqlalchemy: Required for database connection and query execution.
    - pathlib: Utilised for handling file paths.
    - SQLconnect: A custom module for handling configuration details.

Example:
    from this_module import SQLconnector
    connector = SQLconnector(connection_name='my_connection')
    df = connector.sql_to_df('query.sql')

Note:
    Configuration details for database connections should be provided either through
    a YAML file specified by `config_path` or a dictionary `config_dict`.

    """
    A class to handle SQL database connections and operations.

    This class provides methods to connect to a SQL database using SQLAlchemy,
    execute SQL queries, and perform database operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection_name : str
        The name of the connection to be used. This name should correspond to an entry
        in the configuration file or dictionary.
    config_path : str, optional
        The file path of the configuration file. If not provided, a default configuration
        is used.
    config_dict : dict, optional
        A dictionary containing database connection configurations. If provided, it overrides
        the configurations from the file specified in `config_path`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    connection_name : str
        The name of the connection.
    engine : sqlalchemy.engine.Engine
        The SQLAlchemy engine object used for database connections.
