# In this example:                            #
# + 2 unstable nuclides                       #
# + 1st nuclide sometimes transitions to 2nd  #
# + 3 compartments                            #
# + there is transfer of the 1st nuclide      #
#   between cmpts 1 and 2 in both ways        #
# + there is transfer of the 2nd nuclide from #
#   cmpt 2 to 3                               #
#                                             #
