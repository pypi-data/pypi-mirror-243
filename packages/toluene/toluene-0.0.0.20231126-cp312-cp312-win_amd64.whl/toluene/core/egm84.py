    The EGM84 geoid. The EGM84 geoid is a geoid model of the earth. It is based on the WGS84 ellipsoid and is defined
    by a grid of points and the spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonics are used to calculate gravity. The grid is
    used to interpolate the sea level at a point. Created by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the
    data is available at `<https://earth-info.nga.mil/#wgs84-data>`_. It does not come with toluene and must be
    downloaded to use the EGM84 geoid. Opens the interpolation grid zip file and sphereical harmonics zip file into
    the temp dir of this run. The file WWGRID can be found there after super().__init__.
