# Video Content Description (VCD)

VCD is a metadata format designed to enable the description of scene information, particularly efficient for discrete data series, such as image or point-cloud sequences from sensor data.
Originally, VCD focused on video content data, but has been extended to provide structures to describe, potentially, any type of information of a scene.

VCD is defined as a structure of data, and as such, can be represented as a JSON Schema.

The syntax (see [openlabel_json_schema-v1.0.0.json](https://vcd.vicomtech.org/documentation/documentation-vcd#shema)), as a JSON Schema file, contains the full description of the VCD structure. This schema follows the ASAM OpenLABEL standard ([OpenLABEL Concept Paper](https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=3876&token=413e8c85031ae64cc35cf42d0768627514868b2f)).

## Details

## Install

### Python

Using pip (Python >= 3.8)):

```
pip install vcd
```
## Usage

### Python

VCD Python API exposes functions to load, create, manipulate and serialize VCD content.

The recommended way to learn VCD is throuhg the samples at the [test folder](https://github.com/Vicomtech/video-content-description-VCD/blob/master/tests).

As a basic example, VCD can be used in a Python script as follows:

```python
import vcd.core as core
import vcd.types as types

# Create a VCD instance
myVCD = core.VCD()

# Add Objects, Actions, etc.
uid1 = myVCD.add_object(name='ped1', semantic_type='#Pedestrian')
myVCD.add_object_data(uid=uid1, object_data=types.bbox(name="head", val=[0, 0, 100, 200]))

...

# Serialize
myVCD.stringify(pretty=False, validation=True)
```

The API contains useful functions that ensures the produced content is compliant with the syntax. Nevertheless, the VCD class allows the user to access directly the content, in the form of a Python dictionary.

```python
import vcd.core as core

# Create empty vcd object
myVCD = core.vcd()

# Load a VCD file
myVCD.load_from_file('./tests/etc/openlabel100_test_scene_KITTI_Tracking_3.json')

# Access data directly
metadata = myVCD.data['openlabel']['metadata']

# Modify data directly
myVCD['openlabel']['objects'][3]['type'] = "#Car"
...

# Serialize
stringified_vcd = myVCD.stringify(pretty=False, validation=True)
```

This can be useful some times, but it is not recommended, as the dictionary may deviate from a valid VCD syntax. To check if a content is valid, the API exposes a validation function:

```python
# Validate
myVCD.validate(stringified_vcd)
```

This validation function is optionally called when saving to JSON files.

## Versions

VCD is a toolkit with APIs in various programming languages (Python, Typescript, C++) which allows anyone to create, read, update and delete labels that follow the ASAM OpenLABEL standard v1.0.0.

Last version is VCD 6.0.0 compliant with OpenLABEL 1.0.0.

VCD has evolved as follows:

* VCD 1.0 (2013)
* VCD 2.0 (2014)
    * Integrated into Viulib library (module viulib_evaluation)
    * Element-wise and Frame-wise modes
    * XML and JSON serialization via ASL library
* VCD 3.0 (2018)
    * Independent C++ library
    * Element-wise and Frame-wise modes
    * Multi-sensor support
    * JSON serialization via ASL library
    * Pixel-wise loss-less compression modes
    * Comparison routines
* VCD 4.0 (2019)
    * Python API
    * Element and Frame-wise mode simultaneously
    * Multi-sensor and multi-interval
    * Native Python JSON serialization
    * Google's Protocol Buffer serialization
    * Object data 'num' for single numbers, 'vec' for arrays of numbers
* VCD 4.1.3 (2020-2021)
    * Explicit definition of intrinsics, extrinsics and odometry
    * Enhanced timestamping and sync information
    * Enhanced semantics management (RDF triplets)
    * Integrated SCL and complex calibration set-ups
    * Drawing functions
    * Preliminar work on Ontology and Neo4j connection
    * Multi-value attributes ('vec' of strings)
    * Typescript API
    * NPM and Pypi packages
* VCD 5.0.0 (2021)
    * VCD as toolkit to produce OpenLABEL compliant labels
    * Addition of C++ lite version
    * General improvements and consistency (Python, Typescript)
    * Removed support for protobuf serialization
* VCD 6.0.0 (2023)
    * VCD Library for Python separated from other language developments
    * Major Python API update

## Related projects

VCD has been used in the following projects: Cloud-LSVA, VI-DAS, inLane, P-REACT, EWISA, Viulib, begirale, SmaCS, HEADSTART, ACCURATE.

The [DMD](https://dmd.vicomtech.org/) (Driver Monitoring Dataset) project also uses VCD!

If your project also uses VCD, let us know!

## OpenLABEL

Along with the development of VCD, we are participating in the definition of the incoming labeling standard for the automotive sector: ASAM OpenLABEL.

https://www.asam.net/project-detail/asam-openlabel-v100

Since v5.0.0 VCD is shaped to be compliant with the format defined in OpenLABEL v1.0.0.
VCD is the first labeling toolset compliant with the standard and used during the elaboration of the standard to produce samples and create the JSON schema.

## Credits

Vicomtech created VCD in 2013, and since, has maintained VCD syntax and libraries. Developments of VCD were supported and funded by the European Commission (EC) Horizon 2020 programme (project [Cloud-LSVA] (http://cloud-lsva.eu), grant agreement 688099).

VCD was registered at the "Registro territorial de la propiedad intelectual de la comunidad autonoma del Pais Vasco", under number 55-354-17, by the Basque Governement, at 2017/07/07.
