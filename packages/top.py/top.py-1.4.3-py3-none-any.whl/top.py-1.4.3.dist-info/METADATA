# This project is now retired

I do not work on discord bots anymore, and consequently do not use top.gg anymore.

This package should continue to work with v0 of the top.gg API, however will not work with v1 or any newer versions,
assuming they are breaking changes to the API.

You are welcome to fork and continue developing this code should you wish, however, for a project that is guaranteed
to continue being developed well into the future, I recommend you use the
[official python SDK.](//github.com/top-gg/python-sdk).

*I am, however, now creating bots on [matrix](//matrix.org), and even have my own [bot library](https://pypi.org/project/nio-bot)!*

This repository is indefinitely archived.

An alternative wrapper for the [top.gg API](//docs.top.gg)

_Please note, this is **not an official package from top.gg**. We are not
affiliated with top.gg in any way. If you want to install their official
package, please see [their repo](//github.com/top-gg/python-sdk)._

### Introduction

> Warning! top.py is not tested to be compatible with discord.py forks, or any other library than the official 
> discord.py library. If you encounter issues when using another library, please open an issue with as much detail
> and support will be added.

top.py is a python wrapper for the top.gg discord bot list API. top.py aims to
be object-oriented, whereas the official top.gg python SDK is more low-level raw
data.

#### Installation

You can install the latest stable release here:

```shell
pip install top.py
```

But, if you're reading this, you're most likely a developer - you should know
how to install packages by now.

#### Examples

You can see examples in the [examples.md](https://github.com/dragdev-studios/top.py/blob/master/examples.md) file.
