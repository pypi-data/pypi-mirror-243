# Patch CLI 

Patch is a zero-config backend for building data products like customer-facing analytics and external data APIs. Connect a source and deploy low latency Dataset APIs instantly. No need to pre-define models, metrics, or OLAP cubes.

Patch is an end-to-end solution for elevating analytics datasets into production. It often replaces a pipeline out of an analytical warehouse into a production database, the production database itself, a cache, and the access and API layers.   

### Features
* Run analytical queries over large datasets with low latency and without hitting the data warehouse
* Perform time series bucketing, aggregations, grouping, filtering and sorting without writing complicated SQL queries
* Leverage data from Snowflake, BigQuery, or Databricks (coming soon) in customer-facing applications
* Look up single row records with single digit millisecond response times
* Turn your dbt models into memory-backed APIs in minutes
* Query data from your application like a data micro-service  
* Automatically scale horizontally without setting up any infrastructure

### How does it work?
The best part is that you can instantly start building your application without setting up any infrastructure.

Patch replicates your tables into a distributed memory grid and exposes APIs to query the datasets. Data is kept up to date with a built-in change data capture process, and you can optionally integrate with your orchestration tool.  Since the tables are fully replicated, queries never hit the data warehouse directly.

## Getting started: CLI
Please follow our [Installation](https://docs.patch.tech/command-line-interface/installation) then [Basic Usage](https://docs.patch.tech/command-line-interface/basic-usage) recommendations on our documentation site.
